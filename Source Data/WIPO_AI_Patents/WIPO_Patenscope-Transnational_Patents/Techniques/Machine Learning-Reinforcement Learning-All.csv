The network instructs the object to move in one of several directions from the initial state. Upon reaching another state, the model again instructs the object to move in one of several directions. These instructions continue until either: a) the object has completed a cycle by ending up back at a state it has been to previously during this cycle, or b) the object has completed a cycle by reaching the goal state. If the object ends up back at a state it has been to previously during this cycle, the neural network model ends the cycle and immediately begins a new cycle from the present location. When the object reaches the goal state, the neural network model learns that this path is productive towards reaching the goal state, and is given delayed reinforcement in the form of a ""reward"". Upon reaching a state, the neural network model calculates a level of satisfaction with its progress towards reaching the goal state. If the level of satisfaction is low, the neural network model is more likely to override what has been learned thus far and deviate from a path known to lead to the goal state to experiment with new and possibly better paths. If the level of satisfaction is high, the neural network model is much less likely to experiment with new paths. The object is guaranteed to eventually find the best path to the goal state from any starting location, assuming that the level of satisfaction does not exceed a threshold point where learning ceases.   <IMAGE>",G06F 11/22; G06F 15/18; G06F 19/00; G06G 7/60; G06N 3/00; G06N 3/04; G06N 99/00,INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORPORATION,"KENTON, JEROME LYNNE",54157090 21.06.1990 US,

A masking field is a multiple scale, self-similar, automatically gain-controlled cooperative-competitive feedback network F2. Network F2 receives input patterns from an adaptive filter F1 ← F2 that is activated by a prior processing level F1 and behaves like a content-addressable memory. It activates compressed recognition codes that are predictive with respect to the activation patterns flickering across, and competitively inhibits, or masks, codes which are unpredictive with respect to the F1 patterns. In particular, a masking field can simultaneously detect multiple groupings within its input patterns and assign activation weights to the codes for these groupings which are predictive with respect to the contextual information embedded within the patterns and the prior learning of the system. A masking field automatically rescales its sensitivity as the overall size of an input pattern changes, yet also remains sensitive to the microstructure within each input pattern. In this way, masking field more strongly activates a code for the whole F1 pattern than for its salient parts, yet amplifies the code for a pattern part when it becomes a pattern whole in a new input context. A masking field can also be primed by inputs from F1: it can activate codes which represent predictions of how the F1 pattern may envolve in the subsequent time interval. Network F2 also exhibits an adaptive sharpening property: repetition of a familiar F1 pattern can tune the adaptive filter to elicit a more focal spatial activation of its F2 recognition code than does an unfamiliar input pattern. The F2 recognition code also becomes less distributed when an input pattern contains more contextual information on which to base an unambiguous prediction of which F1 pattern is being processed. Thus a masking field suggests a solution of the credit assignment problem by embodying a real-time code for the predictive evidence contained within its input patterns. Such capabilities are useful in speech recognition, visual object recognition, and cognitive information processing. An absolutely stable design for a masking field is disclosed through an analysis of the computer simulations. This design suggests how associative mechanisms, cooperative-competitive interactions, and modulatory gating signals can be joined together to regulate the learning of compressed recognition codes.",G06K 9/66; G10L 15/16,THE TRUSTEES OF BOSTON UNIVERSITY,"GROSSBERG, Stephen; COHEN, Michael","802,479 27.11.1985 US; 934,412 24.11.1986 US",EP-1986907225

People with diabetes face many problems in controlling their glucose because of the complex interactions between food, insulin, exercise, stress, activity, and other physiological and environmental conditions. Established principles of management of glucose sometimes are not adequate because there is a significant amount of variability in how different conditions impact different individuals and what actions might be effective for them. Accordingly, systems and methods according to present principles minimize the impact of the vagaries of diabetes on individuals, i.e., by looking for patterns and tendencies of an individual and customizing the management to that individual.
