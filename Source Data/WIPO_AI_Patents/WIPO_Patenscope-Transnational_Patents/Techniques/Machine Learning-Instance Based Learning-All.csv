For a given data instance, the method first localizes the corruption through several statistical checks via an appropriate anomaly detection algorithm from the machine learning literature. Then the corrupted attributes, which might be considered as ""missing"" after the corruption is localized, are imputed using the average statistics extracted from the data set. In the machine learning applications such as data classification and clustering, data imputation is an important technique to improve the performance of the algorithms, i.e., empirical error rates in case of a binary classification, when a fraction of the data is corrupted under severe noise conditions. For instance, this corruption might be due to a scratch on the compact disc where the data are stored, or occlusion of a visual object in computer vision tasks. In this regard, data imputation techniques and our invention aim at replacing the corrupted or missing parts with statistically meaningful substituted values such that the corrupted parts after imputations becomes statistically consistent with the intact parts.",G06N 7/00; G06N 99/00,ASELSAN ELEKTRONIK SANAYI VE TICARET ANONIM SIRKETI,"OZKAN, Huseyin; YILMAZ, Ozgur",,UA-a201600281; PH-12016500066; KZ-2016/0044.1

Accurate and non-biased prenatal prediction of postnatal disease evolution is currently lacking, but is essential for prenatal counseling and disease management. Here the inventors aimed to develop an objective and quantifiable risk prediction method based on amniotic fluid (AF) peptides. 178 fetuses with bilateral CAKUT were included in a prospective multicenter study. The AF peptide content was studied using capillary electrophoresis coupled to mass spectrometry. The endpoint was early-onset renal failure (CKD stage 3-5) or death due to end-stage renal disease at two years of age. Among the ~7000 peptide candidates, 98 were associated with early severe renal failure. The most frequently found peptides associated with severe disease were fragments from extracellular matrix proteins and thymosin-P4. Combination of those 98 peptides in a classifier lead to the prediction of postnatal renal outcome in a blinded validation set of 51 patients with a 88% (95%CI: 64-98) sensitivity, 97% (95%CI: 85-100) specificity and an AUC of 0.96 (95%CI: 0.87-1.00), outperforming predictions based on currently used clinical methods. The classifier also predicted normal postnatal renal function in 75% of terminated pregnancies where fetopathology showed kidneys compatible with normal life. Analysis of AF peptides thus allows a precise and quantifiable prediction of postnatal renal function in bilateral CAKUT with potential major impact on pre- and postnatal disease management.",G01N 33/68,INSERM (INSTITUT NATIONAL DE LA SANTÉ ET DE LA RECHERCHE MÉDICALE); UNIVERSITÉ PAUL SABATIER TOULOUSE III; CENTRE HOSPITALIER UNIVERSITAIRE DE TOULOUSE,"SCHANSTRA, Joost; KLEIN, Julie; BREUIL, Benjamin; DECRAMER, Stéphane; BUFFIN-MEYER, Bénédicte",18306197.7 14.09.2018 EP,

Then in the identifying step, corresponding groups of pixels at the common resolution in the source and auxiliary images are identified. Then in the deriving step, a mapping function is derived which relates the rate of change of intensity of each group in the auxiliary image and the corresponding rate of change of intensity in the corresponding group in the source image to the intensity vector. This map can be conditioned on any number of auxiliary image planes. In the subdividing step, each source pixel is subdivided.

During the learning phase, each input pattern is normalized in a normalizer, before it is presented to a classifier. If not recognized, it is learned, i.e. the normalized pattern is stored in the classifier as a prototype with its category associated thereto. From a predetermined reference value of that parameter, the normalizer computes an element related to said parameter which allows to set the normalized pattern from the input pattern and vice versa to retrieve the input pattern from the normalized pattern. As a result, all these input patterns are represented by the same normalized pattern.

Generally, the present disclosure is directed to systems and methods for streaming processing (as opposed to batch processing) within the autonomy computing system 106. When an update for a particular object or region of interest is received by a given system, the system can control transmission of data associated with the update as well as a determination of other aspects by the given system. For example, the system can determine based on a received update for a particular aspect and a priority classification (as determined by priority classification system 142) and/or interaction classification determined for that aspect (as determined by interaction classification system 144) whether data associated with the update should be transmitted to a subsequent system before waiting for other updates to arrive. The autonomy computing system 106 therefore includes a data streaming controller 140 to coordinate streaming processing within one or more systems of autonomy computing system 106. With streaming processing, autonomy data can be delivered to other systems in an advanced fashion (e.g., ""ahead of schedule""). In such fashion, an autonomous vehicle can be controlled to react more quickly relative to aspects classified as high- priority. For example, the additional time gained through advancing the autonomy data in a streaming fashion can enable the vehicle to come to a stop more quickly or otherwise make improved maneuvers which enhance passenger and vehicle safety.",G05D 1/00; G01S 17/66; G01S 13/72,"UATC, LLC","BRADLEY, David McAllister; HAYNES, Galen Clark","62/616,542 12.01.2018 US; 15/983,491 18.05.2018 US; 15/983,499 18.05.2018 US; 15/983,504 18.05.2018 US",

The method is based on first obtaining a statistical model of the content of the data in the form of a probability density function. This density is then used to decide how data should be reorganized on disk for efficient nearest neighbor queries. At query time, the model decides the order in which data should be scanned. It also provides the means for evaluating the probability of correctness of the answer found so far in the partial scan of data determined by the model. In this invention a clustering process is performed on the database to produce multiple data clusters. Each cluster is characterized by a cluster model. The set of clusters represent a probability density function in the form of a mixture model. A new database of records is built having an augmented record format that contains the original record attributes and an additional record attribute containing a cluster number for each record based on the clustering step. The cluster model uses a probability density function for each cluster so that the process of augmenting the attributes of each record is accomplished by evaluating each record's probability with respect to each cluster. Once the augmented records are used to build a database the augmented attribute is used as an index into the database so that nearest neighbor query analysis can be very efficiently conducted using an indexed look up process. As the database is queried, the probability density function is used to determine the order clusters or database pages are scanned. The probability density function is also used to determine when scanning can stop because the nearest neighbor has been found with high probability.",G06F 17/30,MICROSOFT CORPORATION,"FAYYAD, Usama; BENNETT, Kristin, P.; GEIGER, Dan","09/189,229 11.11.1998 US",
