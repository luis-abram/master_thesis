These fuzzy logic rules and membership functions data can be stored for use in a fuzzy logic system for neural network based fuzzy antecedent processing, rule evaluation and defuzzification, thereby avoiding heuristics associated with conventional fuzzy logic algorithms. The neural network, used as a fuzzy rule generator to generate fuzzy logic rules and membership functions for the system's plant controller, is a multilayered feed-forward neural network based upon a modified version of a back-propagation neural network and learns the system behavior in accordance with input and output data and then maps the acquired knowledge into a new non-heuristic fuzzy logic system. Interlayer weights of the neural network are mapped into fuzzy logic rules and membership functions. Antecedent processing is performed according to a weighted product of the antecedents.

A neural network is trained using a combination of both back-propagation and genetic algorithm-based methods for optimizing the design of the neural network. The back-propagation and genetic algorithm work together in a collaborative manner in the neural network design. The training starts with incremental learning based on the instantaneous error and the global total error is accumulated for batch updating at the end of the training data being presented to the neural network. The genetic algorithm directly evaluates the performance of multiple sets of neural networks in parallel and then use the analyzed results to breed new neural networks that tend to be better suited to the problems at hand.,G06N 3/08,"CET TECHNOLOGIES PTE LTD.; NG, Yew, Liam; NG, Kim, Chwee","NG, Yew, Liam; NG, Kim, Chwee",9802830-1 31.07.1998 SG,CN-99809212.6; US-09743992

The controller is implemented in three technological bases (software, VLSI and neural network). In another aspect the invention relates to the design of an Intelligent system which implements decision-making procedure based on approximation, association and reasoning with fuzzy patterns and their clearness assessments rather than the use of Max-Min computation over fuzzy relational matrices usually applied in approximate reasoning procedures in similar systems. According to this design the fuzzy controller is a device which operates at the level of fuzzy pattern processing where each control task is expressed through the attributes of fuzzy patterns (syntax and content, domain and clearness measure), and the elementary cognitive activities which the human performs with these patterns such as: recognition, generation, assessment, association, pattern matching, approximation, etc. The fuzzy controller utilizes a new scheme for approximate reasoning with fuzzy patterns called the Clearness Transformation Rule of Inference (CTRI). This mechanism offers a spectrum of advantages broadening the functional Intelligence of the controller to handle complex human tasks, improving the performance and accuracy of the controller and reducing the computational requirements.

The industrial application is the study of vibration and maintenance of rotational devices (motors, turbines, and others which have an intrinsic sinusoidal likewise movement). An EMD is carried out on the acceleration signal which produces a collection of intrinsic mode functions (IMF), on which the Hilbert transform is carried out. A set of parameters extracted from the Hilbert Transformed signal gives information of the deviation of the discontinuities. (1) Number of peaks of the derivative of the Hilbert phase higher than a threshold and normalized to time length of the signal and sampling frequency. (2) Variance or standard deviation of the derivative of the Hubert phase, φ' H(t). (3) Fractal dimension (DF) of the curve (HR(t), H1(t)), Hilbert plane.

The steps of the method include collecting data elements having a range of values from the process. The number of data elements having values within predetermined intervals of the range are then counted. The counts of the data elements are applied as inputs to nodes of a neural network, each count being applied to a node representing the predetermined interval corresponding to the count. Output is then generated from the neural network based on the inputs, the output indicative of whether an error in the process (such as bias error or a precision error) has occurred. Several such neural networks such as one for every combination of error type and data type are employed. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, a moving window is used to collect a predetermined number of data elements each time. The steps of the method are then repeated after moving the window to replace a data element in the window with another data element outside the window. The method may also include scaling the data elements to values within a predetermined range before counting the data elements. This scaling step may comprise scaling the data elements to values within the range of zero to one, for example. When the method is applied to the process of laboratory analysis of patient speciments, the test results generated by a laboratory instrument are counted, and the counts are applied to the neural network. The neural network monitors trends in the test results to detect if the instrument is producing test results within an acceptable range. If test results outside of an acceptable range are detected, the neural network output indicates that an error has occured. The output is generated in real time and available immediately for automatic or manual correction of the instrument.

A three-dimensional smooth response surface is generated to capture the biological relationship between the target and activator-repressor. This novel technique is applied to functionally describe triplets of activators, repressors and targets, and their regulations in gene expression data. A diagnostic strategy is built into the SRS algorithm to evaluate the scores of the triplets so that those with low scores are kept and a regulatory network is constructed based on this information and existing biological knowledge. The predictions based on the identified triplets in two yeast expression data agree with experimental data in the literature.

The surface EEG/EMG signal is collected from three electrodes (1) positioned middle forehead, left forehead and on the cheek, 2 cm below the middle eye line. The novelty of this method and apparatus is that the EMG is separated from the EEG to a such extent that a more reliable feature extraction of the EEG can be carried out, without significant interference from the EMG. This is necessary for example when designing an EEG based index for assessing the level of consciousness during general anaesthesia. The method could be implemented in other devices where a high quality EEG is required. The apparatus consists of electrodes and cable connected to an amplifier, a D/A- converter, a microprocessor which executes the processing and displays the result on a display. In a preferred embodiment, a combination of five or six subparameters is merged into one index, termed IDX, by a classifier. The six subparameters are the Hubert transform of the EEG (8) spectral ratios of the EEG frequencies (9-12) and the electro oculogram (EOG).

Using a pulsed laser light beam (21a) from a laser source (20) that is spread and preferably diffused to avoid ocular damage, an interference pattern is returned to a sensing module (22) through a spectral filter (31). There it is optionally combined with a reference beam from the laser source, modified (25) to emulate coherence length effects, and incident upon a phase transmission holographic template (30) that may be segmented into regions for example. Each region of the holographic template contains Fourier transform images of occupant types. Behind the holographic template is a detector array (33) that is sensitive to the laser light. An interference pattern derived from the object is convoluted or cross-correlated with the template. When an match occurs, a bright spot appears on the detector array. The location of this spot within the region contains position information. The relative brightness and location of spots within each region provide information relative to their classification. Using fuzzy logic, neural networks, or an algebraic algorithm, this information is decoded, and a decision made as to the type and location of the object. With this information, a deployment algorithm for the active restraint device, in conjunction with other information, can make the appropriate choice on whether or not to deploy the device. <IMAGE>",B60R 21/00; G06K 9/76; B60R 21/01; B60R 21/015; G06K 9/00; G06K 9/74; G06K 9/76,DELPHI TECH INC,SCHUBERT PETER; COPELAND MICHELLE,28632699 05.04.1999 US,

A higher level of alarming is provided by using a time integrated approach to account for both intensity of the alarm variable and duration. Combining these different aspects with a predictive model incorporates process-operating conditions to enhance the alarming sensitivity for earlier detection and reduce false positives. Finally, combining the different alarming aspects with a rule-based decision making approach such as fuzzy logic allows alarming based on qualitative analysis of different data streams.
