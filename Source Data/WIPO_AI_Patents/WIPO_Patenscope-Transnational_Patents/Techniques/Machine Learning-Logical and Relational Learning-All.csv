Using as an example CT scan data and the pancreas, the methods can include localizing an organ from an entire 3D CT scan, providing a reliable bounding box for the more refined segmentation step. The methods can further comprise introducing a fully deep-learning approach, based on an efficient application of HNNs on the three orthogonal views. The resulting HNN per-pixel probability maps can then be fused using pooling to reliably produce a 3D bounding box of the pancreas that maximizes the recall. An introduced localizer compares favorably to both a conventional non-deep-learning method and a hybrid approach based on spatial aggregation of superpixels using random forest classification. The segmentation phase can operate within the computed bounding box and can integrate semantic mid-level cues of deeply-learned organ interior and boundary maps, obtained by two additional and separate realizations pf HNNs. By integrating these two mid-level cues, the disclosed methods are capable of generating boundary-preserving pixel-wise class label maps that result in exceptional final organ segmentations.",G06K 9/00; G06T 7/00,"THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, AS REPRESENTED BY THE SECRETARY, DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES","HARRISON, Adam P.; WANG, Xiaosong; SUMMERS, Ronald; NOGUES, Isabella-Emmanuella; ROTH, Holger; LU, Le","62/450,681 26.01.2017 US; 62/345,606 03.06.2016 US",

After this relationship is determined, the computer system sends a current group of input parameters to the neural network, and, based on the analysis of the previous call records, the neural network determines whether a call should be initiated or not.
