Subjected to any data, the present embodiment automatically identifies the relevant variables and constructs the most effective combination of the said relevant variables to achieve one or more objectives. The objective could be for high explanatory power, or high predictive power, or response measure, or other objectives that the user defined within the fitness function. Since the present embodiment will automatically construct the variables composition when subjected to any data to satisfy the objective(s) defined in the fitness function, it is in effect, an adaptive multivariate model building methodology. In other words, the present embodiment's algorithm also solves the need for dynamic capability in multivariate models since its adaptive evolutionary nature will automatically detect and incorporate the most relevant variables. By employing genetic algorithm, the present embodiment can find global optima or near global optima of appropriate variables combination in an acceptable amount of time and resources that are much less than using full variables permutation methodology. The present embodiment, by utilizing genetic algorithm, solves the sequential F-test problem by conducting non- sequential and non-linear search. This is accomplished by allowing at least one or a plurality of genes mutation in random order, hence including or excluding at least one variable in random order. The algorithm solves partial F-test dilemma by the fact that the variable test procedure evaluates the whole genome (i.e. all candidate variables intact) maintaining fidelity of full variables membership test throughout its permutation. Furthermore, the stochastic nature of genetic algorithm neutralizes the prejudices of manual decisions in variables identification, unlike its human modeler counterpart. Variables membership by the algorithm is based on 'survival of the fittest', in which the best genomes (i.e. best combination of variables) will emerge after as the optimal solution among the best of breed. In short, genetic algorithm determines the optimal and a pool of close to optimal multivariate models. The algorithm operates by modifying the parameters of the multivariate models by which it is in fact changing the composition of appropriate variables in the models. Genome population is generated iteratively by the algorithm until the criteria(s) of the desired genome that represent the desired multivariate model has been found within allowable time and reasonable resources.",G06F 17/00,"SOETJAHJA, Hendra","SOETJAHJA, Hendra","60/894,214 10.03.2007 US",EP-2008731411

In particular, embodiments of the invention are concerned with reducing the computational complexity associated with ranking solutions to such problems with respect to one another. <??>Embodiments involve an initial ordering process, wherein the performance of a solution, on all of its objectives, is evaluated, and compared between solutions. In a preferred embodiment, the performance of a solution is evaluated by calculating the distance (in all dimensions) of the evaluated solution, considered as a point in multi-objective space, from the origin of the multi-objective space. The solutions are then preferably arranged as a function of their calculated distance values. Known methods, such as ""Quicksort"", ""Bubble sort"", ""Shell sort"", ""Merge sort"" or ""Heap sort"" (described in ""Algorithms in C<++>"", third Edition, Sedgewick, 1998) can be used to order the solutions as a function of the calculated distance. The ordering of solutions is such that whichever solution is closest to the origin is placed first, and whichever solution is furthest from the origin is placed last, in, e.g., a list of the solutions. The computational time incurred by this ordering is approximately O (N<2>) <??>Subsequently, the list of ordered solutions is input to a ranking process (which utilizes a conventional ranking process such as that described in NSGA). Since the first solution in the list is, by definition, on the Pareto front, then in order to identify solutions in the first level, the solutions only have to be compared against that first solution in the list. Essentially, therefore, the first solution in the list is the benchmark for the Pareto front. Moreover, once those solutions that are not dominated by the first solution, and are thus also lie on the Pareto front, have been identified and removed from the list, the first solution of those remaining in the list will be, by definition, on the second level Pareto front. <??>Conventional Multiobjective genetic algorithm methods incur a computational time of O (mN<3>) (where m denotes objectives, N denotes population size). Since the invention has removed the need to compare all solutions with all other solutions, the computational time involved with comparing solutions with the first solution in the list is now reduced to O (mN<2>), which is a significant improvement compared to other known methods. <IMAGE>",G06N 3/12; G06F 17/50; G06F 17/50; H04L 12/56; G06N 3/12; H04L 12/56,BRITISH TELECOMM,,02254649 02.07.2002 EP,

Since there is no gold standard in breast carcinoma diagnosis, a hybrid system is developed using thermal and electrical impedance imaging methods together. The main ideas composing the invention are: the use of the frequency dependent electrical properties of the tissue for diagnostic aims. The innovation of the approach relies on the frequency dependence of the tissue's electrical impedance which facilitates the acquisition of multiple thermal images with currents at different frequencies injected to the region of the body under inspection. Proposed method without current application (in passive mode of operation) provides images which are obtained by standard thermal imagers. On the other hand, the application of the electrical current (in active mode of operation) increases the temperature contrast on the body surface depending on the electrical property of tissue. Therefore, the technique while increasing the thermal contrast provides frequency dependent conductivity distribution data which can be used as a basis for the detection of the breast carcinoma.

Computational tools and methods are disclosed herein that can be used to design water-soluble variants of helical membrane proteins, using the pentameric phospholamban (PLB) and potassium channel KcsA as models. To water-solublize PLB, the membrane-exposed positions were changed to polar or charged amino acids, while the putative core was left unaltered.

As a probe of the correctness of the fold of the water soluble KcsA, the computationally designed proteins contain an agitoxin-2 binding site from a mammalian homologue of the channel.

In particular, the sign and magnitude of one piece of DPCM data after another are modelled to provide a magnitude state input and a sign state input to provide context for DPCM magnitude input and DPCM sign input, respectively, to an entropy encoder or decoder. That is, the DPCM magnitudes of earlier pieces of (context) DPCM magnitude data are re-mapped for each such earlier piece of data, the re-mapped data being aggregated to form a combined value indicative of the magnitude state input. Similarly, the DPCM signs of earlier pieces of (context) DPCM sign data are re-mapped for each such earlier piece of data, the re-mapped data being aggregated to form a combined value indicative of the sign state input. In an image data compression system, the magnitude state input serves as an activity indicator for picture elements (pixels) neighboring a ""subject"" pixel. According to the invention, the DPCM signal is derived from a difference value calculated by subtracting one of a plurality of predictor values from the graylevel value X of the subject pixel. The selection of predictor value P is based on the value of the magnitude state (activity indicator). In addition, the difference value is subject to adaptive quantization in which one of a plurality of quantizers is employed in assigning the (X-P) difference value to a quantization level.

Weighting values can be applied to calculations when deriving the kernel function. The weighting values can assign different degrees of importance to different regions of the spectrum.
