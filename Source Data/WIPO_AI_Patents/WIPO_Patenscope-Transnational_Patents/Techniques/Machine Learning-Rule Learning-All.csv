Practical applications of video recognition require a label scheme that is appealing to the end-user (i.e. obtained from social curation) and a training dataset that can be updated in real-time to be able to recognize new actions, scenes and people. To create this dataset that evolves in real-time and uses labels that are relevant to the users, a weakly-supervised deep learning approach is utilized combining both a machine-learning pre-processing stage together with a set of keywords obtained from the internet.

The knowledge base of the expert system consists of a hierarchy of terms and their definitions. To produce an expert response, an inference engine component of the expert system evaluates a term by evaluating all of the definitions for the terms which are in that term's hierarchy of definitions. In the document generation system, the terms include fragment terms which are defined as portions of the template document. Other terms of the knowledge base may appear within the portion. The document generation system includes a term definition component which, when the user defines a fragment term, provides the editor to the user so that the user can write the fragment represented by the fragment term. After the user has defined the fragment term, the term definition component adds the fragment term to the knowledge base and verifies that any other terms in the portion are defined in the knowledge base. If they are not, the user is asked for a definition. To produce a document, the inference engine evaluates a term which is defined in terms of one or more fragment terms. When the evaluation indicates that a fragment term is to be included in the document, the inference engine uses the editor to retrieve any other terms in the fragment, evaluates the other terms, and then uses the editor to copy the fragment term's text from the template document to the document being produced and to replace the other terms in the document being produced with their values.",G06F 9/44; G06F 17/21; G06F 17/24; G06N 5/02; G06N 5/04,WANG LABORATORIES,GOLDSTEIN HENRY; SHANNON DAVID F; BOLLING RICHARD W; RUSTICI ERIC,37143489 05.06.1989 US; 9001776 03.04.1990 US,

EP14012156,02252733,18.04.2002,1355240,22.10.2003,EP,Data analysis method,"Current classification methods attempt to classify each classification value into a separate class. Consequently, a lot of effort is dedicated to distinguishing between two or more similar classification objects, meaning that supervised learning procedures are slow and produce classifiers that are excessively large. Moreover, the classifiers are often difficult to understand, and take a long time to be generated. <??>Embodiments of the invention are concerned with reducing the number of classification values that can be used to classify a data item. Relationships between classification values are identified on the basis of attribute values in a set of training data, and those classification values that are determined to be related to one another are subsumed into a single classification group. <??>An embodiment of the invention is thus concerned with identifying groups of classification values corresponding to a set of data, where each data item in the set is characterised by a plurality of attributes, and each attribute has one of a plurality of attribute values associated therewith. The method comprises the steps of:  (i) selecting an attribute; (ii) identifying, on the basis of the distribution of attribute values, two classification values that are least similar to one another and allocating a first identified classification value to a first group and a second identified classification value to a second group; (iii) allocating each unidentified classification value to one of the groups in dependence on correlation between the unidentified classification value and the first and second identified classification values; (iv) evaluating an association between the first and second groups and the selected attribute; (v) repeating steps (i) to (iv) for each of at least some of the plurality of attributes (vi) comparing associations evaluated at step (iv) and selecting first and second groups corresponding to the weakest association; (vii) for each of the first and second groups repeating steps (i) to (vi) for the classification values therein, until the association evaluated at step (iv) falls below a predetermined threshold value.  <??>Essentially classification groups are repeatedly analysed with respect to a range of attributes so as to identify all possible groupings of classification values. For example, classification values Daily Mail, Daily Express, The Times, The Guardian, Vogue, New Scientist, Economist, Cosmopolitan, FHM, House and Garden are analysed with respect to a selection of attributes (e.g. sex, age, occupation etc.). Assuming that the analysis identifies the classification values as falling within two classification groups: ÄDaily Mail, Daily Express, Cosmopolitan, FHMÜ and ÄThe Times, The Guardian, Vogue, New Scientist, Economist, House and GardenÜ, each of these groups is then analysed with respect to the same, or a different, selection of attributes.

Consequently, a lot of effort is dedicated to distinguishing between two or more similar classification objects, meaning that supervised learning procedures are slow and produce classifiers that are excessively large. Moreover, the classifiers are often difficult to understand, and take a long time to be generated. Embodiments of the invention are concerned with reducing the number of classification values that can be used to classify a data item. Relationships between classification values are identified on the basis of attribute values in a set of training data, and those classification values that are determined to be related to one another are subsumed into a single classification group. An embodiment of the invention is thus concerned with identifying groups of classification values corresponding to a set of data, where each data item in the set is characterised by a plurality of attributes, and each attribute has one of a plurality of attribute values associated therewith. The method comprises the steps of: (i) selecting an attribute; (ii) identifying, on the basis of the distribution of attribute values, two classification values that are least similar to one another and allocating a first identified classification value to a first group and a second identified classification value to a second group; (iii) allocating each unidentified classification value to one of the groups in dependence on correlation between the unidentified classification value and the first and second identified classification values;(iv) evaluating an association between the first and second groups and the selected attribute;(v) repeating steps (i) to (iv) for each of at least some of the plurality of attributes;(vi) comparing associations evaluated at step (iv) and selecting first and second groups corresponding to the weakest association; (vii) for each of the first and second groups repeating steps (i) to (vi) for the classification values therein, until the association evaluated at step (iv) falls below a predetermined threshold value. Essentially classification groups are repeatedly analysed with respect to a range of attributes so as to identify all possible groupings of classification values. For example, classification values Daily Mail, Daily Express, The Times, The Guardian, Vogue, New Scientist, Economist, Cosmopolitan, FHM, House and Garden are analysed with respect to a selection of attributes (e.g. sex, age, occupation etc.). Assuming that the analysis identifies the classification values as falling within two classification groups: [Daily Mail, Daily Express, Cosmopolitan, FHM] and [The Times, The Guardian, Vogue, New Scientist, Economist, House and Garden], each of these groups is then analysed with respect to the same, or a different, selection of attributes. This second round of analysis may identify further clusters of classification values - e.g. the analysis could show that the classification values in the latter group are clustered into two distinct groups: [House and Garden, Vogue] and [The Times, The Guardian, New Scientist, Economist]. After each round of analysis an association between the groups and attributes is measured and is compared with a threshold; this comparison identifies whether or not the groups are sufficiently different as to justify splitting up the classification values into groups.",G06F 17/30; G06K 9/62; G06K 9/68,"BRITISH TELECOMMUNICATIONS PUBLIC LIMITED COMPANY; HO, Colin, Kok, Meng; NAUCK, Detlef, Daniel","HO, Colin, Kok, Meng; NAUCK, Detlef, Daniel",02252733.7 18.04.2002 EP,

First, as each transformation used to map one hierarchy to a related one performs only local changes to the hierarchy, it will have only minor and easily computed effects on any instance. Second, most transformations will have no effect on many instances.
