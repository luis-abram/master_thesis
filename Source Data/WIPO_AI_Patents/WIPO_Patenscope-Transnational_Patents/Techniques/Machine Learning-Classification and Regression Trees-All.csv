The accuracy of the acoustic modelling is quantified by the rank of the correct phone. The invention includes a microphone for converting an utterance into an electrical signal. The signal from the microphone is processed by an acoustic processor and label match which finds the best-matched acoustic label prototype from the acoustic label prototype store. A probability distribution on phone boundaries is then produced for every time frame using the first decision tree described in the invention. These probabilities are compared to a threshold and some time frames are identified as boundaries between phones. An acoustic score is computed, for all phones between every given pair of hypothesized boundaries, and the phones are ranked on the basis of this score. The second decision tree is traversed for every time frame to obtain the worst case rank of the correct phone at that time, and using the phone score and phone rank computed in, a shortlist of allowed phones is made up for every time frame. This information is used to select a subset of acoustic word models in store, and a fast acoustic word match processor matches the label string from the acoustic processor against this subset of abridged acoustic word models to produce an utterance signal. The utterance signal output by the fast acoustic word match processor comprises of at least one word. In general, however, the fast acoustic word match processor will output a number of candidate words. Each word signal produced by the fast acoustic word match processor is input into a word context match which compares the word context to language models in store and outputs at least one candidate word. From the recognition candidates produced by the fast acoustic match and the language model, the detailed acoustic match matches the label string from the acoustic processor against detailed acoustic word models in store and outputs a word string corresponding to an utterance. <IMAGE>",G10L 15/00; G10L 15/02; G10L 15/04; G10L 15/14,IBM,NAHAMOO DAVID; PADMANABHAN MUKUND,34701394 30.11.1994 US,

This model first screens genes to reduce noise, applies k-means correlation-based clustering, and then uses singular-value decompositions to extract the single dominant factor (principal component) from each cluster. This generates a statistically significant number of cluster-derived singular factors, that we refer to as metagenes, which characterize multiple patterns of expression of the genes across samples. The strategy aims to extract multiple such patterns while reducing dimension and smoothing out gene­specific noise through the aggregation within clusters. Formal predictive analysis then uses these metagenes in a Bayesian classification tree analysis. This generates multiple recursive partitions of the sample into subgroups ('leaves' of the tree), and associates Bayesian predictive probabilities of outcomes with each subgroup. Overall predictions for an individual sample are then generated by averaging predictions, with appropriate weights, across many such tree models. The model includes the use of iterative out-of-sample cross-validation predictions to perform refitting of the model, and mirrors the real-world prognostic context where prediction of new cases as they arise is the major goal.",G06F 19/00; G06G 7/48; G06N 3/00; G06N 5/00; G06N 7/00,"DUKE UNIVERSITY; NEVINS, Joseph, R.; WEST, Mike; HUANG, Andrew, T.","NEVINS, Joseph, R.; WEST, Mike; HUANG, Andrew, T.","60/420,729 24.10.2002 US; 60/421,062 25.10.2002 US; 60/421,102 25.10.2002 US; 60/424,715 08.11.2002 US; 60/424,718 08.11.2002 US; 60/424,701 08.11.2002 US; 60/425,256 12.11.2002 US; 60/448,462 21.02.2003 US; 60/448,461 21.02.2003 US; 60/457,877 27.03.2003 US; 60/458,373 31.03.2003 US",EP-2003783074; JP-null

Using as an example CT scan data and the pancreas, the methods can include localizing an organ from an entire 3D CT scan, providing a reliable bounding box for the more refined segmentation step. The methods can further comprise introducing a fully deep-learning approach, based on an efficient application of HNNs on the three orthogonal views. The resulting HNN per-pixel probability maps can then be fused using pooling to reliably produce a 3D bounding box of the pancreas that maximizes the recall. An introduced localizer compares favorably to both a conventional non-deep-learning method and a hybrid approach based on spatial aggregation of superpixels using random forest classification. The segmentation phase can operate within the computed bounding box and can integrate semantic mid-level cues of deeply-learned organ interior and boundary maps, obtained by two additional and separate realizations pf HNNs.

The packet buffer stores inbound packets, and includes a header data extractor to extract header data from the inbound packets and to store the extracted header data in a header data cache. The header data extractor also generates a header data cache index and provides it to the packet classification engine for it to retrieve the extracted header data. The packet classification engine has a decision tree-based classification logic for classifying a packet. Each of the leaves of the tree represents a packet classification. The packet classification engine uses the header data cache index to retrieve the header data to perform multiple header checks, starting at a root of the tree and traversing branches until a leaf has been reached. The application engine has a number of programmable sub-engines arrayed in a pipelined architecture. The packet classification engine provides start indicators based on the packet classification to the programmable sub-engines to identify application programs to be executed. The sub-engines includes a source lookup engine, a destination lookup engine and a disposition engine, which are used to make a disposition decision for the inbound packets in a processing pipeline.

EP14012156,02252733,18.04.2002,1355240,22.10.2003,EP,Data analysis method,"Current classification methods attempt to classify each classification value into a separate class. Consequently, a lot of effort is dedicated to distinguishing between two or more similar classification objects, meaning that supervised learning procedures are slow and produce classifiers that are excessively large. Moreover, the classifiers are often difficult to understand, and take a long time to be generated. <??>Embodiments of the invention are concerned with reducing the number of classification values that can be used to classify a data item. Relationships between classification values are identified on the basis of attribute values in a set of training data, and those classification values that are determined to be related to one another are subsumed into a single classification group. <??>An embodiment of the invention is thus concerned with identifying groups of classification values corresponding to a set of data, where each data item in the set is characterised by a plurality of attributes, and each attribute has one of a plurality of attribute values associated therewith. The method comprises the steps of:  (i) selecting an attribute; (ii) identifying, on the basis of the distribution of attribute values, two classification values that are least similar to one another and allocating a first identified classification value to a first group and a second identified classification value to a second group; (iii) allocating each unidentified classification value to one of the groups in dependence on correlation between the unidentified classification value and the first and second identified classification values; (iv) evaluating an association between the first and second groups and the selected attribute; (v) repeating steps (i) to (iv) for each of at least some of the plurality of attributes (vi) comparing associations evaluated at step (iv) and selecting first and second groups corresponding to the weakest association; (vii) for each of the first and second groups repeating steps (i) to (vi) for the classification values therein, until the association evaluated at step (iv) falls below a predetermined threshold value.  <??>Essentially classification groups are repeatedly analysed with respect to a range of attributes so as to identify all possible groupings of classification values. For example, classification values Daily Mail, Daily Express, The Times, The Guardian, Vogue, New Scientist, Economist, Cosmopolitan, FHM, House and Garden are analysed with respect to a selection of attributes (e.g. sex, age, occupation etc.). Assuming that the analysis identifies the classification values as falling within two classification groups: ÄDaily Mail, Daily Express, Cosmopolitan, FHMÜ and ÄThe Times, The Guardian, Vogue, New Scientist, Economist, House and GardenÜ, each of these groups is then analysed with respect to the same, or a different, selection of attributes. This second round of analysis may identify further clusters of classification values - e.g. the analysis could show that the classification values in the latter group are clustered into two distinct groups: ÄHouse and Garden, VogueÜ and ÄThe Times, The Guardian, New Scientist, EconomistÜ. After each round of analysis an association between the groups and attributes is measured and is compared with a threshold; this comparison identifies whether or not the groups are sufficiently different as to justify splitting up the classification values into groups. <IMAGE>",G06F 17/30; G06F 17/30; G06K 9/62; G06K 9/68,BRITISH TELECOMM,,02252733 18.04.2002 EP,

Consequently, a lot of effort is dedicated to distinguishing between two or more similar classification objects, meaning that supervised learning procedures are slow and produce classifiers that are excessively large. Moreover, the classifiers are often difficult to understand, and take a long time to be generated. Embodiments of the invention are concerned with reducing the number of classification values that can be used to classify a data item. Relationships between classification values are identified on the basis of attribute values in a set of training data, and those classification values that are determined to be related to one another are subsumed into a single classification group. An embodiment of the invention is thus concerned with identifying groups of classification values corresponding to a set of data, where each data item in the set is characterised by a plurality of attributes, and each attribute has one of a plurality of attribute values associated therewith. The method comprises the steps of: (i) selecting an attribute; (ii) identifying, on the basis of the distribution of attribute values, two classification values that are least similar to one another and allocating a first identified classification value to a first group and a second identified classification value to a second group; (iii) allocating each unidentified classification value to one of the groups in dependence on correlation between the unidentified classification value and the first and second identified classification values;(iv) evaluating an association between the first and second groups and the selected attribute;(v) repeating steps (i) to (iv) for each of at least some of the plurality of attributes;(vi) comparing associations evaluated at step (iv) and selecting first and second groups corresponding to the weakest association; (vii) for each of the first and second groups repeating steps (i) to (vi) for the classification values therein, until the association evaluated at step (iv) falls below a predetermined threshold value. Essentially classification groups are repeatedly analysed with respect to a range of attributes so as to identify all possible groupings of classification values. For example, classification values Daily Mail, Daily Express, The Times, The Guardian, Vogue, New Scientist, Economist, Cosmopolitan, FHM, House and Garden are analysed with respect to a selection of attributes (e.g. sex, age, occupation etc.). Assuming that the analysis identifies the classification values as falling within two classification groups: [Daily Mail, Daily Express, Cosmopolitan, FHM] and [The Times, The Guardian, Vogue, New Scientist, Economist, House and Garden], each of these groups is then analysed with respect to the same, or a different, selection of attributes. This second round of analysis may identify further clusters of classification values - e.g. the analysis could show that the classification values in the latter group are clustered into two distinct groups: [House and Garden, Vogue] and [The Times, The Guardian, New Scientist, Economist]. After each round of analysis an association between the groups and attributes is measured and is compared with a threshold; this comparison identifies whether or not the groups are sufficiently different as to justify splitting up the classification values into groups.",G06F 17/30; G06K 9/62; G06K 9/68,"BRITISH TELECOMMUNICATIONS PUBLIC LIMITED COMPANY; HO, Colin, Kok, Meng; NAUCK, Detlef, Daniel","HO, Colin, Kok, Meng; NAUCK, Detlef, Daniel",02252733.7 18.04.2002 EP,

When an existing CTTS system is to be updated in order to adapt it to a new application, an application-specific new text must be read by a natural person in a new recording session (32).

This is disadvantageously time-consuming and expensive, as the human speaker, who made the preceding basic session should also be available in the update speech session. The present invention only requires a relatively small amount of application-specific new text, and no additional speech recordings at all. The inventional adaptation of the existing CTTS system is achieved by an application-specific reorganization of the synthesizer's speech database by means of certain decision tree modifications. By that reorganization certain synthesis units (631, 632) are made available for the new application, which are not available in prior art without a new speech session.

Doctors' actions are directed by a prescriptive protocol - a checklist of discrete steps designed for efficient or optimal care of an individual patient's specific condition. The step-by-step checklist is abstracted from decision tree guidelines for the optimal work up and treatment for the condition using probability-based methodology. The care protocols can be derived from widely available and non-proprietary guidelines and decision trees based on public medical research literature. In one embodiment, the invention can be employed by a primary care clinician at the point of referral into the specialist sector, and at the specialist level when proposing a risky or expensive or otherwise problematic medical or surgical diagnostic or treatment intervention. At these two critical transaction points in care, the checklist functions like a lock, based on a hidden clinical decision algorithm (an explanation of which can be displayed upon request).

Each feature has three or more possible values. First, the predictor feature value and the category feature value of each event is measured. From the measured predictor feature values, the joint probabilities of each category feature value and each predictor feature value are estimated. The events are then split, arbitrarily, into two sets of predictor feature values. From the estimated joint probabilities, the conditional probability of an event falling into one set of predictor feature values is calculated for each category feature value. A number of pairs of sets of category feature values are then defined where each set SYj contains only those category feature values having the j lowest values of the conditional probability. From among these pairs of sets, an optimum pair is found having the lowest uncertainty in the value of the predictor feature.

An automated attendant is coupled to the speech recognition system for converting a spoken name of a hotel guest entered from one of the telephone extensions into a predefined hotel guest name that can be used to retrieve an assigned telephone extension from the hotel registration system. Next, the automated attendant causes the telephone switching system to call the requested telephone extension in response to the entry of the spoken name from one of the telephone extensions. <IMAGE>",G10L 15/06; G10L 11/00; G10L 15/14; G10L 15/26; H04M 3/42,MATSUSHITA ELECTRIC IND CO LTD,JUNQUA JEAN-CLAUDE; CONTOLINI MATTEO,7039998 30.04.1998 US,

This is obtained when coefficients are found for the similarity function which result in an error rate that is considered to be an acceptable level. A method for modelling a similarity function using a neural network comprises the steps of: (a) inputting feature vectors to a raw input stage of a neural network respectively for objects S in the given category, for other objects G in the same category being compared the objects S, and for objects B outside the given category; (b) coupling the raw inputs of feature vectors for S, G, and B to an input layer of the neural network performing respective set operations required for the similarity function so as to have a property of monotonicity; (c) coupling the input elements of the input layer to respective processing elements of an hidden layer of the neural network for computing similarity function results adaptively with different values of a coefficient w of the similarity function; (d) coupling the processing elements of the hidden layer to respective output elements of an output layer of the neural network for providing respective outputs of an error function measuring the extent to which objects S is more similar to objects G than to objects B; and (e) obtaining an optimal coefficient w by back propagation through the neural network which minimizes the error outputs of the error function. <IMAGE>",G06K 9/62; G06N 3/04,SIEMENS AG,"SCHWANKE, ROBERT W.; HANSON, STEPHEN J.",69864691 10.05.1991 US,

Accurate and non-biased prenatal prediction of postnatal disease evolution is currently lacking, but is essential for prenatal counseling and disease management. Here the inventors aimed to develop an objective and quantifiable risk prediction method based on amniotic fluid (AF) peptides. 178 fetuses with bilateral CAKUT were included in a prospective multicenter study. The AF peptide content was studied using capillary electrophoresis coupled to mass spectrometry. The endpoint was early-onset renal failure (CKD stage 3-5) or death due to end-stage renal disease at two years of age. Among the ~7000 peptide candidates, 98 were associated with early severe renal failure. The most frequently found peptides associated with severe disease were fragments from extracellular matrix proteins and thymosin-P4. Combination of those 98 peptides in a classifier lead to the prediction of postnatal renal outcome in a blinded validation set of 51 patients with a 88% (95%CI: 64-98) sensitivity, 97% (95%CI: 85-100) specificity and an AUC of 0.96 (95%CI: 0.87-1.00), outperforming predictions based on currently used clinical methods. The classifier also predicted normal postnatal renal function in 75% of terminated pregnancies where fetopathology showed kidneys compatible with normal life. Analysis of AF peptides thus allows a precise and quantifiable prediction of postnatal renal function in bilateral CAKUT with potential major impact on pre- and postnatal disease management.",G01N 33/68,INSERM (INSTITUT NATIONAL DE LA SANTÉ ET DE LA RECHERCHE MÉDICALE); UNIVERSITÉ PAUL SABATIER TOULOUSE III; CENTRE HOSPITALIER UNIVERSITAIRE DE TOULOUSE,"SCHANSTRA, Joost; KLEIN, Julie; BREUIL, Benjamin; DECRAMER, Stéphane; BUFFIN-MEYER, Bénédicte",18306197.7 14.09.2018 EP,

A time-over-threshold counter (112) determines the number of pixels in the image signals having magnitudes greater than or less than the reference thresholds. The distribution of pixel intensities is supplied to a decision tree algorithm (116) that determines whether the gain of the intensified CCD transducers (44a, 44b) used to produce the autofluorescence images or the intensity of the excitation light produced by a light source (36) should be increased or decreased.

EP12630787,94114205,09.09.1994,0655684,31.05.1995,EP,Branch decision encoding scheme,"The BRANCH DECISION ENCODING SCHEME shown herein overcomes the limitations of a dedicated debug port on a single chip computer processor. A dedicated debug port resolves many of the problems associated with an add-on logic analyzer, except for its limitation of an eight bit data interface. The 8 bit port is required as a trade-off between the device I/O requirements and development tools. During real time program development, it is virtually impossible to monitor the 24 bit program counter through a port only a third as wide. The present invention solves this problem by taking advantage of the sequential characteristics of application programs. There is a discontinuity in the program counter in only a limited number of situations: branches, jumps, subroutine calls and returns from subroutines, exceptions and returns from exceptions, traps and return from traps, and loopbacks to the tops of loops. Therefore, by monitoring most of these discontinuities, it becomes possible to compress the 24 bit data so that it can be output through the 8 bit port in real time. For example, branch decisions can be defined by noting only that they occurred, and if they were taken or not taken, i.e., ""1"" or ""0"". The results of the decision tree are contained within the program and can be reconstructed in an external work station. To maintain synchronization, the absolute value of the program counter is updated periodically as the opportunity presents itself. It is always updated following indirect jumps.",G06F 11/00; G06F 11/28; G06F 9/30; G06F 11/36; G06F 15/78,ROCKWELL INTERNATIONAL CORP,FOLWELL DALE EUGENE; CLARK RICKE WAYLAN; HARENBERG DONALD DEAN,155891  ; US19930155891  ; 15589193 23.11.1993 US,
