These plans are generated using both imaging and non-imaging data. To accomplish this, the CDSS is interfaced with imaging systems (CADx, CAD, PACS etc.). A data-mining operation is performed to identify relevant patients with similar attributes such as diagnosis, medical history, treatment, etc from imaging and non-imaging data. Natural language processing is employed to extract and encode relevant non-imaging (textual) data from relevant patients' records. Additionally, an image of a current patient is compared to reference images in a patient database to identify relevant patients. Relevant patients are then identified to a user, and the user selects a relevant patient to view detailed information related to medical history, treatment, guidelines, efficacy, and the like.",G06F 19/00,"KONINKLIJKE PHILIPS ELECTRONICS N.V.; PHILIPS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY & STANDARDS GMBH; TULIPANO, Paola, Karina; BOROCZKY, Lilla; LEE, Michael, Chun-chieh; VLOEMANS, Victor, Paulus, Marcellus; CARLSEN, Ingwer, Curt; OPFER, Roland; LAGOR, Charles","TULIPANO, Paola, Karina; BOROCZKY, Lilla; LEE, Michael, Chun-chieh; VLOEMANS, Victor, Paulus, Marcellus; CARLSEN, Ingwer, Curt; OPFER, Roland; LAGOR, Charles","61/051,895 09.05.2008 US",US-12989805; CN-200980116705.7; RU-2010150473; JP-2011508039; IN-7811/CHENP/2010; EP-2009742527
