Massive multimedia collections are analyzed by Internet crawling and a knowledge base is maintained that updates in real time with no need of human supervision. As a result, each video is indexed with a rich set of labels and linked with other related contents. Practical applications of video recognition require a label scheme that is appealing to the end-user (i.e. obtained from social curation) and a training dataset that can be updated in real-time to be able to recognize new actions, scenes and people. To create this dataset that evolves in real-time and uses labels that are relevant to the users, a weakly-supervised deep learning approach is utilized combining both a machine-learning pre-processing stage together with a set of keywords obtained from the internet. The resulting tags combined with videos and summaries of videos are used with deep learning to train a neural network in an unsupervised manner that allows the tagging system to go from an image to a set of tags for the image and then to the visual representation of a tag.",G06E 1/00; G06F 17/30; G06N 5/02,"VILYNX, INC.","BOU BALUST, Elisenda; RIVEIRO INSUA, Juan Carlos; FERNANDEZ CAÃELLAS, Delia; ESPADALER RODÃS, Joan; ADURIZ BERASATEGI, Asier; VARAS GONZÃLEZ, David","62/414,308 28.10.2016 US; 62/552,369 30.08.2017 US",EP-2017866015

The prior art describes certain mechanics for developing or generating rules. That process is commonly known as the knowledge acquisition process. Having acquired the knowledge, our new troubleshooting arrangement eliminates the prior art separation between the expert system knowledge acquisition process and the expert system utilization process. Our new arrangement also detects and classifies invalid actions or other errors of the user in a manner that allows for the non-human expert system to advise the human user. Our arrangement interactively communicates between a user and a troubleshooting system, generates a learning knowledge base, identifies an object being tested by the user, utilizes the learning knowledge base for troubleshooting the test object, and classifies the test object as faulty or not faulty. Our arrangement structures prior actions of the user as pairs of elements in a multi-branch tree in the learning knowledge base and the compares present actions of the user with the prior actions of the user. A current signal path is generated between a first input and a first output in the system under test. Then, it can be determined whether the test object belongs to the current signal path. Responsive to the comparison of the actions of the user and responsive to whether the test object belongs to the current path, the skill level of the user can be classified into one of a plurality of skill levels. Responsive to the skill level classification of the user, the kind of troubleshooting advice to be given the user can be classified as to one of a plurality of kinds of troubleshooting advice and thereafter the advice can be communicated to the user.

In particular, this invention allows the breakdown of highly complex biological spectral signals into high dimensional feature space where local features of each sub-space are accurately correlated with both a specific metabolite concentration or a categorical condition. Such is achieved by a new self-learning method, that requires no human intervention. The developed artificial intelligence is able to establish its own knowledgebase when new data is fed by performing feature space transformations, searching directions of co-variance and optimizing local composition-spectral correlations. These methods allow the artificial intelligence to establish knowledge maps of both quantifications and classifications, that can be cashed for higher computational performance. In particular, direct search comprises of finding across the feature space data and dimensions that allow a direct linear correspondence between metabolic composition and spectral bands variance. Moreover, a similar approach is derived for defining the convex hull regions of different class of health conditions from body fluid spectra. Such results in the creation of knowledge maps for both quantification and classification. The present invention also allows to evaluate 'a priori' the predictability, accuracy and precision of new estimates. Furthermore, this invention provides a self-learning approach to de definition of the global feature space using big data, for its correct characterization under high variability, accurate detection of local anomalies, as well as, outliers that can contaminate the knowledge base. This invention is applicable to all regions of the electro-magnetic spectra used in spectroscopy analysis (x-ray, uv, vis, nir, ir, far-ir and microwaves), or with any other type of spectroscopy (absorvance, reflectance, fluorescence, phosphorescence, Raman scattering) where complex multi-scale interference and biological variability is present.

At each stage, to go from a fault hierarchy KBk to its neighbor KBk+1, the computer system must evaluate KBk's accuracy over C, as well as the accuracy of each KB'  ELEMENT  N(KBk). The computer system provides an efficient way of evaluating the accuracy of KBk, and each &thetas;i(KBk), towards determining which, if any, &thetas;i(KBk) is more accurate than KBk. It exploits a few key observations. First, as each transformation used to map one hierarchy to a related one performs only local changes to the hierarchy, it will have only minor and easily computed effects on any instance. Second, most transformations will have no effect on many instances. Finally, one can bound how much the accuracy score for a knowledge base can change based on any instance, which means branch-and-bound techniques can be used to avoid computing the accuracy scores for various hierarchies that cannot be optimal. <IMAGE>",G06N 5/00; G06N 5/02,SIEMENS CORP RES INC,GREINER RUSSELL; RAO R BHARAT; MEREDITH GLENN A,58462996 10.01.1996 US,

A user's request is compiled and transformed, in the stochastically indexed form, into a plurality of new requests that are equivalent to the original request; and stochastically indexed fragments of textual documents that comprise all word combinations of the transformed request are selected. A stochastically indexed structure is generated from the selected documents and basing on said structure by means of logical conclusion a brief reply of the system is generated. Relevancy of the obtained brief reply is checked by generating an interrogative sentence based on said reply, and by comparing said sentence with the request.

The techniques are particularly useful for programs having class predicates and subclass predicates which are definitive of a class/sub-class hierarchy, such as the case with PROLOG's application in object-oriented programming systems, expert systems, object-oriented databases, object-oriented deductive databases, knowledge representations, etc. The techniques ensure that searching within the type hierarchy takes precedence over searching of instances of types. Important to accomplishing this function is the pre-assigning of ranks to predicates and clauses within the program to be processed. Query processing on the program is then based upon the pre-assigned predicate and clause rankings. In particular, novel rules are substituted for conventional predicate and clause selection rules of PROLOG interpreters such that predicates and clauses are preferably processed in order of ranking. In addition, certain query processing simplification steps are introduced. The net effect is a technique which eliminates redundant and unnecessary searching at the instance level by taking advantage of information available in the type lattice. <IMAGE>",G06F 9/44; G06F 12/00; G06F 17/30; G06N 5/00,IBM,"DALAL, MUKESH; GANGOPADHYAY, DIPAYAN",80132391 02.12.1991 US,

The efficiency of the calculations is ensured by the high training rate of the given neural network, as well as the parallelism of the calculation streams not only in the recognition of images, but in the neural network training. Furthermore, the described neural network model can easily be realized in the form of an analogue arrangement, which significantly improves the efficiency of its apparative realization. The said neural network training is based on a novel structure and a novel principle of functioning of the neural synapse forming the neural network structure and performing the function of transmission and transformation of a signal. The training takes place under counter-propagation of direct and backward signals, where the direct signal performs the recognition of the image, and the counter (reverse) signal ensures the neural network training. The difference in the direct and reverse signals at the output of the neuron is the basis for error compensation and, consequently, leads to the training of the neuron and the whole neural network. The information carrier (memory) in the given neural network is dendrites (neuron inputs), and also neuron synapses with dendrites of other neurons. The structure of the connections between the neurons is in principle unimportant. The contribution of dendrites is defined not only by weight coefficient, and by weight ranges. Training is carried out by modification of parameters of synapses and weight ranges of dendrites of a neuron. Thus, plasticity of a neural network is ensured not only by identical weights of dendrites, but through ranges of the weights of dendrites and adaptation of the functions of signal transformation (transfer functions) on synapses. Synapses ensure not simple signal transmission between neurons, but also transform these signals. Notably, transformation of signals on synapses has the complex non-linear functional nature depending on value of a signal coming at the synapse.",G06N 3/04; G06N 3/08,"PESCIANSCHI, Dmitri; FRENKEL, Christina; FRENKEL, Daniel; HAEMMERLING, Valentin","PESCIANSCHI, Dmitri",,

The present invention operates on mechanical parts described as solid models. The process employs well-defined solid models of the part to be machined and the raw stock from which it will be machined. The volumetric difference between the stock and the part defines the material (delta volumes) that must be cut away during the actual machining process. Delta volumes are solid models, and users (or an expert system) can subdivide delta volumes into smaller volumes that are consistent with a manufacturing process plan. A delta volume and a user-defined strategy for machining the delta volume are then input to NC algorithms. The algorithms generate NC tool paths that remove as much delta volume material as possible. Tool volumes are automatically generated from NC tool paths to represent the volume traversed by the cutting tool. By subtracting the tool volume from the delta volume, the material that remains to be machined is modeled and stored as new delta volumes. The subtraction of the tool volume from the stock defines a new stock model that represents the incremental change in stock when the NC tool path is processed at the machine tool. The process is repeated until all delta volumes have been machined and the part has been manufactured. <IMAGE>",B23Q 15/00; G05B 19/4097; G06F 17/50,SPATIAL TECHNOLOGY INC,SOWAR RICHARD M; HEINY WILLIAM C; OLSEN PAUL C; HOTCHKISS MARK R; DIXON THOMAS L; RICHARD CHARLES W JR; RAINES MICHAEL D,66994391 15.03.1991 US,

The CNN universal machine (100) has the special properties that it is 1) programmable and 2) includes local memory (112).

Rule based intelligence is applied to the operations set and/or one or more operation choice set by a set of rules associated with its respective operation and/or choice set. When one or more rules in a rule set are applied to the operation set, an offered operation set is created which is a subset of the operation set. Only the operations in the offered operation set are offered to the user. When one or more rules in a rule set are applied to a choice set, an offered choice set is created which is a subset of the choice set. Only those operation choices in the offered choice set are offered to the user. The operations (operation choices) that are in the offered operation set (offered choice set) are those that conform to the constraints of the rules that are applied. The user selects operations (operation choices) from the offered operation set (offered choice set). Information about the user selections feeds back to the rules and is used to constrain the next offered operations and operation choices. The user is also permitted to change rules, rule specific metadata, and rule specific metadata algorithms as well as the data in the system.

The objective function for optimization is cycle time, which can be obtained from available robotic CAD software. The research domains are simplified, and the SA method is applied to yield an optimal or near-optimal solution to each problem. To obtain the optimal placement of the robot, the research domain is first simplified by determining an acceptable base location domain, then obstacle shadows, which are subtracted from the previous domain to give the free acceptable base location domain. A modified SA method is applied to this domain, using task feasibility tests before simulating the cycle time, in order to save CPU time.

The representation of ligand-receptor interaction used along with the binding affinity of said interaction is used to train a determining means in a form of a predictive model. Prediction of binding affinity of a novel (not used for training of a predictive model) ligand-receptor interaction, involving a peptide and a particular receptor, involves the combining of representations of both peptide and receptor and presenting that representation to a previously trained predictive model. The system and method can be used as a single predictive model for determination of ligand binding to an individual receptor, or to a group of related receptors.

Each choice can include a disjunction identifier and a choice identifier identifying one of the disjuncts of the identified disjunction. The logical combination of choices in a context identifier thus corresponds to a combination of disjuncts, all of which could be from different disjunctions. If two data units have context identifiers identifying contexts that are genuine alternatives, those data units are not unified. Data units that have context identifiers that are not genuine alternatives are unified. A set of context-value pairs, referred to as a disjunctive value, can be unified with another disjunctive value by considering all combinations of pairs of context identifiers that include one context identifier from each disjunctive value. The number of combinations of context identifiers in each disjunctive value is reduced by combining context-value pairs: Pairs with equal value tokens are combined by merging their context identifiers and unifying the value tokens. Pairs with f-structures as values are combined by merging context identifiers and unifying the f-structures. An equality within a disjunct is handled by unifying the equated entities, but only in the context appropriate to that disjunct. If it is necessary to insert a pointer, the pointer is inserted so that it initially leads to a disjunctive value, with the source of the pointer indicating which of the context-value pairs in the disjunctive value is to be accessed.

In the method, the object geometry is first defined in terms of object (subdomain) points (152), wherein each subdomain is a separate geometric region of the object such as a printed circuit board, a hole in the board, and a component mounted on the board. Bounding points defining a frame around the object geometry are then generated for producing a mesh consisting of at least one element (154). From the object points and the bounding points an initial mesh of elements is automatically generated according to a unique algorithm (156, 158). In the second step of the process, each element in this mesh is then individually examined to determine if it meets a predetermined standard of acceptability and, if not, is refined (197-206). This process step employs a rule-based expert system to add additional points to the mesh at automatically determined locations for further mesh generation according to the unique algorithm employed. The steps of refinement repeat until each element in the mesh meets the acceptability standard or is considered no longer refinable.",G06F 17/50; G06T 17/20,MENTOR GRAPHICS CORPORATION,"WEISS, JONATHAN; FORTNER, PATRICK, D.",15110588 01.02.1988 US,

The output of this rule component, in the form of a data structure consisting of attribute-value pairs, is then processed by the argument-structure component, which consists of a set of partially ordered procedures that incorporate further linguistic knowledge. The output of these procedures is the same attribute-value structure, now enhanced by the presence of semantic (i.e., meaningful, non-syntactic) attributes.

The method is based on first obtaining a statistical model of the content of the data in the form of a probability density function. This density is then used to decide how data should be reorganized on disk for efficient nearest neighbor queries. At query time, the model decides the order in which data should be scanned. It also provides the means for evaluating the probability of correctness of the answer found so far in the partial scan of data determined by the model. In this invention a clustering process is performed on the database to produce multiple data clusters. Each cluster is characterized by a cluster model. The set of clusters represent a probability density function in the form of a mixture model. A new database of records is built having an augmented record format that contains the original record attributes and an additional record attribute containing a cluster number for each record based on the clustering step. The cluster model uses a probability density function for each cluster so that the process of augmenting the attributes of each record is accomplished by evaluating each record's probability with respect to each cluster. Once the augmented records are used to build a database the augmented attribute is used as an index into the database so that nearest neighbor query analysis can be very efficiently conducted using an indexed look up process. As the database is queried, the probability density function is used to determine the order clusters or database pages are scanned. The probability density function is also used to determine when scanning can stop because the nearest neighbor has been found with high probability.",G06F 17/30,MICROSOFT CORPORATION,"FAYYAD, Usama; BENNETT, Kristin, P.; GEIGER, Dan","09/189,229 11.11.1998 US",

Upon subsequently receiving a query, the SQE parses the query similarly and searches the indexed stored data set to locate data that contains similar terms used in similar grammatical roles. In this manner, the SQE is able to achieve more contextually accurate search results more frequently than using traditional search engines.",G06F 17/30,"INSIGHTFUL CORPORATION; MARCHISIO, Giovanni, B.; KOPERSKI, Krzysztof; LIANG, Jisheng; MURUA, Alejandro; NGUYEN, Thien","MARCHISIO, Giovanni, B.; KOPERSKI, Krzysztof; LIANG, Jisheng; MURUA, Alejandro; NGUYEN, Thien","60/312,385 14.08.2001 US; 10/007,299 08.11.2001 US",EP-2002757098; MX-PA/a/2004/001488; CA-2457693; JP-null; NZ-531177; AU-2002323136

The system works as an information system through which the user is able to add many levels of dimensions in and above an information space, and at the same time is able to explore, search, view and in other ways work upon the different dimensions and combinations of dimensions of information in the information space. The system is able to work upon information existing within the computer environment, information existing outside the computer environment, information inputted into the system, information derived from other information. Through this system, information from diverse sources can be structurised, managed, organised, associated, meta, contextualised, searched, explored, visualised and re-represented from a single platform. By utilising the concept of information spaces and information entities, which enables the system to create an environment where information spaces can be combined with a whole range of other concepts, the user is able to use many different metaphors to operate on information. These metaphors open up new possibilities for the ways the user can utilise and interact with the information environment, thus solving many problems users face when dealing with information in existing information systems, such as information overload, inability to easily correlate information, limitations due to information locality, inability to flexibly organise information within strict hierarchies, inability to express user ideas on any information. Strategic and flexible combinations of these metaphors when implemented in various embodiments of the present invention can thus enable users to operate on information within computer systems as if a natural extension of their ideas, rather than separate information stores. In one embodiment, the system is able to act as an information augmentation platform, where the user by using tools provided can express much more information upon existing information in available domains. In another example, the system is able to act as an information re-representer, where existing user information can be re-represented to express different, and often hidden, aspects of the information. In another example, the system is able to act as a common information management platform, where the user is able to consolidate different types of information required for a project or task from a multiplicity of sources into one common place, where this information can be structured and accessed coherently with high relevancy. The possible uses of this system are possibly manifold. The present invention changes way people store, retrieve, understand and see their information or knowledge. Users can now create meaning above information, penning down ideas, comments and adding dimensions into or above the information space. Work processes can thus be more seamless and information is made much more holistic and all rounded. Instead of users trying to work within a previously limited information space, users are now able to work within an extended, multidimensional, augmentable information space which allows for much more expressibility, allowing users to express or work using any form of information or idea above or within any information, knowledge or aspect of the information space.",G06F 17/30; G06Q 10/00,"SOH, Eng, Lee; GOH, Koon, Yiak","SOH, Eng, Lee; GOH, Koon, Yiak",200900684-2 31.01.2009 SG,
