Direct kernel methods are used to separate abnormal MCG heart patterns from normal ones. For unsupervised learning, Direct Kernel based Self-Organizing Maps are introduced. For supervised learning Direct Kernel Partial Least Squares and (Direct) Kernel Ridge Regression are used. These results are then compared with classical Support Vector Machines and Kernel Partial Least Squares. The hyper-parameters for these methods are tuned on a validation subset of the training data before testing. Also investigated is the most effective pre-processing, using local, vertical, horizontal and two-dimensional (global) Mahanalobis scaling, wavelet transforms, and variable selection by filtering. The results, similar for all three methods, were encouraging, exceeding the quality of classification achieved by the trained experts. Thus, a device and associated method for classifying cardiography data is disclosed, comprising applying a kernel transform to sensed data acquired from sensors sensing electromagnetic heart activity, resulting in transformed data, prior to classifying the transformed data using machine learning.",A61B 5/08,"CARDIOMAG IMAGING, INC.

In particular, this invention allows the breakdown of highly complex biological spectral signals into high dimensional feature space where local features of each sub-space are accurately correlated with both a specific metabolite concentration or a categorical condition. Such is achieved by a new self-learning method, that requires no human intervention. The developed artificial intelligence is able to establish its own knowledgebase when new data is fed by performing feature space transformations, searching directions of co-variance and optimizing local composition-spectral correlations. These methods allow the artificial intelligence to establish knowledge maps of both quantifications and classifications, that can be cashed for higher computational performance. In particular, direct search comprises of finding across the feature space data and dimensions that allow a direct linear correspondence between metabolic composition and spectral bands variance. Moreover, a similar approach is derived for defining the convex hull regions of different class of health conditions from body fluid spectra. Such results in the creation of knowledge maps for both quantification and classification. The present invention also allows to evaluate 'a priori' the predictability, accuracy and precision of new estimates. Furthermore, this invention provides a self-learning approach to de definition of the global feature space using big data, for its correct characterization under high variability, accurate detection of local anomalies, as well as, outliers that can contaminate the knowledge base. This invention is applicable to all regions of the electro-magnetic spectra used in spectroscopy analysis (x-ray, uv, vis, nir, ir, far-ir and microwaves), or with any other type of spectroscopy (absorvance, reflectance, fluorescence, phosphorescence, Raman scattering) where complex multi-scale interference and biological variability is present.

Since kMER adapts not only the neuron weights but also the radii of the kernels centered at these weights, and since these radii are updated so that they model the local input density at convergence, these radii can be used directly, in variable kernel density estimation. The data density function at any neuron is assumed to be convex and a cluster of related data comprises one or more neurons. The data density function may have a single radius, e.g. a hypersphere. A processing engine and a method for developing a kernel-based topographic map which is then used in data model-based applications are also described. The receptive field of each kernel is disjunct from the others, i.e. overlapping. The engine may include a tool for self-organising and unsupervised learning, a monitoring tool for maximising the degree of topology achieved, for example, by using the overlapping kernels, and a tool for automatically adjusting the kernel widths to achieve equiprobabilism.

A three-dimensional smooth response surface is generated to capture the biological relationship between the target and activator-repressor. This novel technique is applied to functionally describe triplets of activators, repressors and targets, and their regulations in gene expression data. A diagnostic strategy is built into the SRS algorithm to evaluate the scores of the triplets so that those with low scores are kept and a regulatory network is constructed based on this information and existing biological knowledge. The predictions based on the identified triplets in two yeast expression data agree with experimental data in the literature. The invention provides a novel model with attractive mathematical and statistical features that make the algorithm valuable for mining expression or concentration information in gene expression analysis for determining the function of uncharacterized proteins, as well as for developing a more accurate understanding of coherent regulatory pathways. <IMAGE>",G06F 19/00; C12N 15/09; C12M 1/00; C12Q 1/68; G06F 17/00; G06F 17/30; G06F 19/00,WARNER LAMBERT CO,TIDWELL CARL; WANG YIXIN; WU CHIEN-FU JEFF; WU PEIRU; XU HONGQUAN,29729901 11.06.2001 US,

Then the server enables the enterprise to use business rules to define the population of browsers that are eligible for chat invitations. Out of this population, the server, on behalf of individual agents, approaches browsers as randomly as possible. As agents are entering into engagements and recording their disposition codes, the server periodically determines if it can identify any patterns in behavior of those engagements that end up with a good disposition code. For example, the server may note that browsers who were invited to chat in the 8th minute of their session and those who had seen 2 product pages end up in good engagements four times more often than the average browser. Once a sufficient sample set of engagements is conducted to allow the server to develop a statistically valid profile/model of browsers who end up with good engagements, the server compares all new browsers against this model and provides a numeric number representing how close the new browser is to the model.

The method is based on first obtaining a statistical model of the content of the data in the form of a probability density function. This density is then used to decide how data should be reorganized on disk for efficient nearest neighbor queries. At query time, the model decides the order in which data should be scanned. It also provides the means for evaluating the probability of correctness of the answer found so far in the partial scan of data determined by the model. In this invention a clustering process is performed on the database to produce multiple data clusters. Each cluster is characterized by a cluster model. The set of clusters represent a probability density function in the form of a mixture model. A new database of records is built having an augmented record format that contains the original record attributes and an additional record attribute containing a cluster number for each record based on the clustering step. The cluster model uses a probability density function for each cluster so that the process of augmenting the attributes of each record is accomplished by evaluating each record's probability with respect to each cluster. Once the augmented records are used to build a database the augmented attribute is used as an index into the database so that nearest neighbor query analysis can be very efficiently conducted using an indexed look up process. As the database is queried, the probability density function is used to determine the order clusters or database pages are scanned. The probability density function is also used to determine when scanning can stop because the nearest neighbor has been found with high probability.",G06F 17/30,MICROSOFT CORPORATION,"FAYYAD, Usama; BENNETT, Kristin, P.; GEIGER, Dan","09/189,229 11.11.1998 US",
