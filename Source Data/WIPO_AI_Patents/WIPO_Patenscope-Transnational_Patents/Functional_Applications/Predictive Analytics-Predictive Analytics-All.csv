This model first screens genes to reduce noise, applies k-means correlation-based clustering, and then uses singular-value decompositions to extract the single dominant factor (principal component) from each cluster. This generates a statistically significant number of cluster-derived singular factors, that we refer to as metagenes, which characterize multiple patterns of expression of the genes across samples. The strategy aims to extract multiple such patterns while reducing dimension and smoothing out gene­specific noise through the aggregation within clusters. Formal predictive analysis then uses these metagenes in a Bayesian classification tree analysis. This generates multiple recursive partitions of the sample into subgroups ('leaves' of the tree), and associates Bayesian predictive probabilities of outcomes with each subgroup. Overall predictions for an individual sample are then generated by averaging predictions, with appropriate weights, across many such tree models.

In particular, this invention allows the breakdown of highly complex biological spectral signals into high dimensional feature space where local features of each sub-space are accurately correlated with both a specific metabolite concentration or a categorical condition. Such is achieved by a new self-learning method, that requires no human intervention. The developed artificial intelligence is able to establish its own knowledgebase when new data is fed by performing feature space transformations, searching directions of co-variance and optimizing local composition-spectral correlations. These methods allow the artificial intelligence to establish knowledge maps of both quantifications and classifications, that can be cashed for higher computational performance. In particular, direct search comprises of finding across the feature space data and dimensions that allow a direct linear correspondence between metabolic composition and spectral bands variance. Moreover, a similar approach is derived for defining the convex hull regions of different class of health conditions from body fluid spectra. Such results in the creation of knowledge maps for both quantification and classification. The present invention also allows to evaluate 'a priori' the predictability, accuracy and precision of new estimates. Furthermore, this invention provides a self-learning approach to de definition of the global feature space using big data, for its correct characterization under high variability, accurate detection of local anomalies, as well as, outliers that can contaminate the knowledge base. This invention is applicable to all regions of the electro-magnetic spectra used in spectroscopy analysis (x-ray, uv, vis, nir, ir, far-ir and microwaves), or with any other type of spectroscopy (absorvance, reflectance, fluorescence, phosphorescence, Raman scattering) where complex multi-scale interference and biological variability is present.

Once the header text (5), attachments (4) or other forwarded materials have been identified in the preprocessing step (10), these components of the email (3) are categorized by the computer (51) as non-author composed text. Next the process flow of the parsing computer (51) moves to the step of normalization (11). This entails processing the email document (3) to ascertain whether it is in a preferred format and, if the email document (3) is not in the preferred format, converting at least some of the information within the email document to the preferred format. The parsing computer (51) now progresses through several analysis steps, referred to as the segmentation step (12), the linguistic analysis step (13) and the punctuation analysis step (14).

The linguistic analysis step (13) includes identification of predefined words and phrases of various types. In the punctuation analysis step (14) the parsing computer (51) analyses the text at the character level so as to check for use of sentence punctuation marks and other predefined characters.

The system is neural network-based and involves processing a sequence of spoken utterance, e.g. separately articulated letters of a name, to identify the same based upon a highest probability match of each utterance with learned speech tokens, e.g. the letters of the English language alphabet, and based upon a highest probability match of the uttered sequence with a defined utterance library, e.g. a list of names. First, the spoken utterance is digitized or captured and processed into a spectral representation. Second, discrete time frames of the spectral representation are classified phonetically using the spectral coefficients. Third, the time-frame outputs are used by a modified Viterbi search to locate segment boundaries, near which such segment boundaries lies the information that is needed to discriminate letters. Fourth, the segmented or bounded representation is reclassified using such information into individual hypothesized letters. Fifth, successive, hypothesized letter scores are analyzed to obtain a high probability match with a spelled word within the utterance library. The system and method comprehend finer distinctions near points of interest used to discriminate difficult-to-recognize letter pair differences such as M/N, B/D, etc..

Subjected to any data, the present embodiment automatically identifies the relevant variables and constructs the most effective combination of the said relevant variables to achieve one or more objectives. The objective could be for high explanatory power, or high predictive power, or response measure, or other objectives that the user defined within the fitness function. Since the present embodiment will automatically construct the variables composition when subjected to any data to satisfy the objective(s) defined in the fitness function, it is in effect, an adaptive multivariate model building methodology. In other words, the present embodiment's algorithm also solves the need for dynamic capability in multivariate models since its adaptive evolutionary nature will automatically detect and incorporate the most relevant variables. By employing genetic algorithm, the present embodiment can find global optima or near global optima of appropriate variables combination in an acceptable amount of time and resources that are much less than using full variables permutation methodology. The present embodiment, by utilizing genetic algorithm, solves the sequential F-test problem by conducting non- sequential and non-linear search. This is accomplished by allowing at least one or a plurality of genes mutation in random order, hence including or excluding at least one variable in random order. The algorithm solves partial F-test dilemma by the fact that the variable test procedure evaluates the whole genome (i.e. all candidate variables intact) maintaining fidelity of full variables membership test throughout its permutation. Furthermore, the stochastic nature of genetic algorithm neutralizes the prejudices of manual decisions in variables identification, unlike its human modeler counterpart. Variables membership by the algorithm is based on 'survival of the fittest', in which the best genomes (i.e. best combination of variables) will emerge after as the optimal solution among the best of breed. In short, genetic algorithm determines the optimal and a pool of close to optimal multivariate models. The algorithm operates by modifying the parameters of the multivariate models by which it is in fact changing the composition of appropriate variables in the models. Genome population is generated iteratively by the algorithm until the criteria(s) of the desired genome that represent the desired multivariate model has been found within allowable time and reasonable resources.",G06F 17/00,"SOETJAHJA, Hendra","SOETJAHJA, Hendra","60/894,214 10.03.2007 US",EP-2008731411

Accurate and non-biased prenatal prediction of postnatal disease evolution is currently lacking, but is essential for prenatal counseling and disease management. Here the inventors aimed to develop an objective and quantifiable risk prediction method based on amniotic fluid (AF) peptides. 178 fetuses with bilateral CAKUT were included in a prospective multicenter study. The AF peptide content was studied using capillary electrophoresis coupled to mass spectrometry. The endpoint was early-onset renal failure (CKD stage 3-5) or death due to end-stage renal disease at two years of age. Among the ~7000 peptide candidates, 98 were associated with early severe renal failure. The most frequently found peptides associated with severe disease were fragments from extracellular matrix proteins and thymosin-P4. Combination of those 98 peptides in a classifier lead to the prediction of postnatal renal outcome in a blinded validation set of 51 patients with a 88% (95%CI: 64-98) sensitivity, 97% (95%CI: 85-100) specificity and an AUC of 0.96 (95%CI: 0.87-1.00), outperforming predictions based on currently used clinical methods. The classifier also predicted normal postnatal renal function in 75% of terminated pregnancies where fetopathology showed kidneys compatible with normal life. Analysis of AF peptides thus allows a precise and quantifiable prediction of postnatal renal function in bilateral CAKUT with potential major impact on pre- and postnatal disease management.",G01N 33/68,INSERM (INSTITUT NATIONAL DE LA SANTÉ ET DE LA RECHERCHE MÉDICALE); UNIVERSITÉ PAUL SABATIER TOULOUSE III; CENTRE HOSPITALIER UNIVERSITAIRE DE TOULOUSE,"SCHANSTRA, Joost; KLEIN, Julie; BREUIL, Benjamin; DECRAMER, Stéphane; BUFFIN-MEYER, Bénédicte",18306197.7 14.09.2018 EP,

This chemical alteration leads to a change in the physical properties, such as the fluorescence of the leaves. Due to the complexity of the material of the leaves, the present method proposes that the signal be treated with statistical methods and that the classification is made through softwares based on machine learning. As an example of the application of the invention, the results are shown for the Greening disease in citrus. Currently, Greening is the most severe citrus disease since there is no treatment available for it and due to its high dissemination rate and the fact that it affects all varieties of orange trees, being the diagnosis performed through visual inspection, which renders high subjectivity, high error percentage and the disease is only diagnosed after the expression of the symptoms (~8 months). During the asymptomatic phase, the infected tree is a source of dissemination of the disease. The present invention can perform the asymptomatic diagnosis of Greening disease from the leaf with a percentage of correct diagnosis higher than 80%.",G01N 21/64; G01J 3/44; G01N 21/25; G01N 33/00,EMPRESA BRASILEIRA DE PESQUISA AGROPECUARIA EMBRAPA,MILORI DÉBORA MARCONDES BASTOS PEREIRA; NETO LADISLAU MARTIN; FERREIRA EDNALDO JOSÉ; ZAGHI ANA FLÁVIA; VENÂNCIO ANDRÉ LEONARDO,2009000317 14.10.2009 BR; PI0805608 15.12.2008 BR,

The average vector calculating portion (5) calculates an average vector for each of the noise region and the speech region of the input speech and a reference pattern received from a spectrum converting portion (4) corresponding to matching information received from a preliminary matching portion (2). The compensating portion (6) compensates the average vectors calculated by the average vector calculating portion (5) for at least one of the time sequence of the spectra of the input speech and the time sequence of the spectra of the reference pattern so that the average vector of the time sequence of the spectra of the noise region of the input speech matches with the average vector of the time sequence of the spectra of the noise region of the reference pattern and that the average vector of the time sequence of the spectra of the speech region of the input speech matches with the average vector of the time sequence of the spectra of the speech region of the reference pattern. The matching portion (8) finally matches the reference pattern with the input speech and outputs a recognition result. Since additive noise and noise conditions of the channel distortion of input speech to be recognized are quickly matched with those of a reference pattern, even if the additive noise and microphone and the transmission channel through which the input speech is collected are unknown when the input speech is trained and the additive noise and the noise conditions vary for each input speech, the speech recognition apparatus can precisely recognize speech without influenced by environmental noise.

Low average bit rates are achieved by only employing high fidelity modes (i.e., high bit rate, broadly applicable to different types of speech) during portions of the speech where this fidelity is required for acceptable output. Lower bit rate modes are used during portions of speech where these modes produce acceptable output. Input speech signal is classified into active and inactive regions. Active regions are further classified into voiced, unvoiced, and transient regions. Various coding modes are applied to active speech, depending upon the required level of fidelity. Coding modes may be utilized according to the strengths and weaknesses of each particular mode. The apparatus dynamically switches between these modes as the properties of the speech signal vary with time.

The necessity of monitoring the patient over a period of time is, therefore, avoided, advantageously allowing clinical intervention before the onset of serious symptoms of sepsis.",C12Q 1/68; G01N 33/68,"BECTON, DICKINSON AND COMPANY; IVEY, Richard; GENTLE, Thomas; MOORE, Richard; TOWNS, Michael; BACHUR, Nicholas; ROSENSTEIN, Robert; NADEAU, James; GOLDENBAUM, Paul; SHI, Song; COPERTINO, Donald; GARRETT, James; TICE, Gregory","IVEY, Richard; GENTLE, Thomas; MOORE, Richard; TOWNS, Michael; BACHUR, Nicholas; ROSENSTEIN, Robert; NADEAU, James; GOLDENBAUM, Paul; SHI, Song; COPERTINO, Donald; GARRETT, James; TICE, Gregory","60/425,322 12.11.2002 US; 60/511,644 17.10.2003 US",AU-2003291482; JP-2004552103; MX-PA/a/2005/005073; CA-2505902; CN-200380108673.9; EP-2003768885; IN-1200/CHENP/2005
