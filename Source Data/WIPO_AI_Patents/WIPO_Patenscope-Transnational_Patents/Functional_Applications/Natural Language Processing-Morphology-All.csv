The method includes creating databases of stochastically indexed dictionaries, tables of indices of linguistic texts and knowledge bases of morphological analysis; performing morphological and syntactical analysis, and also stochastic indexing of textual documents in respect to a given theme from the search system in a given language, and creating knowledge base of syntactical analysis. Stochastically indexed textual documents pertaining to the given theme are subjected to semantic analysis, and knowledge bases of semantic analysis. A user's request is compiled and transformed, in the stochastically indexed form, into a plurality of new requests that are equivalent to the original request; and stochastically indexed fragments of textual documents that comprise all word combinations of the transformed request are selected. A stochastically indexed structure is generated from the selected documents and basing on said structure by means of logical conclusion a brief reply of the system is generated. Relevancy of the obtained brief reply is checked by generating an interrogative sentence based on said reply, and by comparing said sentence with the request.

Ratings associated with the captured motion can also be displayed. Predicted ball flight path data can be calculated and displayed. Data shown on a time line can also be displayed to show the relative peaks of velocity for various parts of the user's body. Based on the display of data, the user can determine the equipment that fits the best and immediately purchase the equipment, via the mobile device.
