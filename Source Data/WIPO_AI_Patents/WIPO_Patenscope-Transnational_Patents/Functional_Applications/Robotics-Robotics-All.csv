The action is applied to the environment. A reward token indicative of alignment between the action and a desired result is received. A policy parameter of the control system is updated based on the reward token. The updated policy parameter is applied to determine a subsequent action responsive to a subsequent observation.,G06N 3/04; G05B 13/02; G06N 3/08,UNITED TECH CORPORATION,GIERING MICHAEL J; REDDY KISHORE K; VENUGOPALAN VIVEK; SURANA AMIT; SARKAR SOUMALYA,201662417804 04.11.2016 US,

The proposed Joint Deep Learning (JDL) model incorporates a multilayer perceptron (MLP) and convolutional neutral network (CNN), and is implemented via a Markov process involving iterative updating. In the JDL, LU classification conducted by the CNN is made conditional upon the LC probabilities predicted by the MLP. In turn, those LU probabilities together with the original imagery are re-used as inputs to the MLP to strengthen the spatial and spectral feature representation.

The network instructs the object to move in one of several directions from the initial state. Upon reaching another state, the model again instructs the object to move in one of several directions. These instructions continue until either: a) the object has completed a cycle by ending up back at a state it has been to previously during this cycle, or b) the object has completed a cycle by reaching the goal state. If the object ends up back at a state it has been to previously during this cycle, the neural network model ends the cycle and immediately begins a new cycle from the present location. When the object reaches the goal state, the neural network model learns that this path is productive towards reaching the goal state, and is given delayed reinforcement in the form of a ""reward"". Upon reaching a state, the neural network model calculates a level of satisfaction with its progress towards reaching the goal state. If the level of satisfaction is low, the neural network model is more likely to override what has been learned thus far and deviate from a path known to lead to the goal state to experiment with new and possibly better paths. If the level of satisfaction is high, the neural network model is much less likely to experiment with new paths. The object is guaranteed to eventually find the best path to the goal state from any starting location, assuming that the level of satisfaction does not exceed a threshold point where learning ceases.   <IMAGE>",G06F 11/22; G06F 15/18; G06F 19/00; G06G 7/60; G06N 3/00; G06N 3/04; G06N 99/00,INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORPORATION,"KENTON, JEROME LYNNE",54157090 21.06.1990 US,

Generally, for better training, the training data should be as large as possible. Unfortunately, manually tagging images is time consuming and susceptible to error, making it difficult to produce the large sets of tagged data used to train artificial neural networks. To address this problem, the inventors have developed a smart tagging utility that uses a feature extraction unit and a fast-learning classifier to learn tags and tag images automatically, reducing the time to tag large sets of data. The feature extraction unit and fast-learning classifiers can be implemented as artificial neural networks that associate a label with features extracted from an image and tag similar features from the image or other images with the same label.

As a result, an edge device with L-DNN can learn continuously after deployment, eliminating massive costs in data collection and annotation, memory and data storage, and compute power. This fast, local, on-device learning can be used for security, supply chain monitoring, disaster and emergency response, and drone-based inspection of infrastructure and properties, among other applications.",G06K 9/46; G06K 9/62; G06K 9/00; G06K 9/36; G06K 9/48,"NEURALA, INC.","LUCIW, Matthew; OLIVERA, Santiago; GORSHECHNIKOV, Anatoly; WURBS, Jeremy; VERSACE, Heather Ames; VERSACE, Massimiliano","62/503,639 09.05.2017 US; 62/612,529 31.12.2017 US",CA-3061767; KR-1020197035963; EP-2018799281

The efficiency of the calculations is ensured by the high training rate of the given neural network, as well as the parallelism of the calculation streams not only in the recognition of images, but in the neural network training. Furthermore, the described neural network model can easily be realized in the form of an analogue arrangement, which significantly improves the efficiency of its apparative realization. The said neural network training is based on a novel structure and a novel principle of functioning of the neural synapse forming the neural network structure and performing the function of transmission and transformation of a signal. The training takes place under counter-propagation of direct and backward signals, where the direct signal performs the recognition of the image, and the counter (reverse) signal ensures the neural network training. The difference in the direct and reverse signals at the output of the neuron is the basis for error compensation and, consequently, leads to the training of the neuron and the whole neural network. The information carrier (memory) in the given neural network is dendrites (neuron inputs), and also neuron synapses with dendrites of other neurons. The structure of the connections between the neurons is in principle unimportant. The contribution of dendrites is defined not only by weight coefficient, and by weight ranges. Training is carried out by modification of parameters of synapses and weight ranges of dendrites of a neuron. Thus, plasticity of a neural network is ensured not only by identical weights of dendrites, but through ranges of the weights of dendrites and adaptation of the functions of signal transformation (transfer functions) on synapses. Synapses ensure not simple signal transmission between neurons, but also transform these signals. Notably, transformation of signals on synapses has the complex non-linear functional nature depending on value of a signal coming at the synapse.",G06N 3/04; G06N 3/08,"PESCIANSCHI, Dmitri; FRENKEL, Christina; FRENKEL, Daniel; HAEMMERLING, Valentin","PESCIANSCHI, Dmitri",,

The search/sort circuit is adapted to determine the minimum distance among said calculated distances. Each search/sort circuit (502-1) is comprised of p elementary base units (510-11 to 510-41) connected in series and disposed in a column direction. The distance bit signals of the same bit rank are applied to said base units according a line direction. As a consequence, the base units of the aggregate circuit are organized in a matrix. The feedback signal corresponds to the signal obtained by performing an OR function in an OR gate (12.1) between all the local output signals generated by the base units of a determined line. The search process is based on the search of zeroes in the distance bit signals, from the MSB's to the LSB's. If a zero is found in a determined line, all the columns which have a one in this line are excluded from the following search. The process is continued until it remains only one distance: the searched minimum distance, that is finally available at the output of the said OR circuit. The above described search/sort circuit can be significantly improved by adjoining a latch based circuit so that the aggregate circuit is now capable to sort the remaining distances in an increasing order. <MATH>",G06F 15/18; G06F 7/544; G06N 3/00; G06N 3/04; G06N 3/06; G06N 3/063,IBM; PAILLET GUY,BOULET JEAN-YVES; TANNHOF PASCAL; PAILLET GUY,94480071 28.07.1994 EP,

In one approach, spiking neurons receive sensory stimulus and context signal that correspond to the same context. When the stimulus provides sufficient excitation, neurons generate response. Context connections are adjusted according to inverse spike-timing dependent plasticity. When the context signal precedes the post synaptic spike, context synaptic connections are depressed. Conversely, whenever the context signal follows the post synaptic spike, the connections are potentiated. The inverse STDP connection adjustment ensures precise control of feedback- induced firing, eliminates runaway positive feedback loops, enables self-stabilizing network operation. In another aspect of the invention, the connection adjustment methodology facilitates robust context switching when processing visual information. When a context (such an object) becomes intermittently absent, prior context connection potentiation enables firing for a period of time.

This distinction is based on the respective values of the input (DCI) and output (DCO) signals of the daisy chain circuit. The ready to learn neuron circuit is the only neuron circuit of the neural network whose said input and output signals are complementary to each other. It is built around a 1-bit register (601) controlled by a store enable signal (ST) which is set active at initialization or during the learning phase when a new neuron circuit must be engaged. The input terminal of the first daisy chain circuit in the chain is connected to a first logic value, so that it is the ready to learn neuron circuit by construction after initialization. After initialization, all the registers of the chain are set to a second logic value. In the learning phase, the 1-bit register contents of the ready to learn neuron circuit is set to the said first logic value by the store enable signal, it is said ""engaged"". The following neuron circuit in the chain then becomes the new ready to learn neuron circuit.

This in essence minimizes the spectral distortion between the boundaries of adjacent instances thereby producing more natural sounding speech.   <IMAGE>,G10L 13/06; G06F 3/16; G10L 13/06; G10L 13/08,MICROSOFT CORP,HUANG XUEDONG D; PLUMPE MICHAEL D; ACERO ALEJANDRO; ADCOCK JAMES L,64880896 30.04.1996 US,

The present invention also provides a personal portable information terminal realizing new portable terminal communications which do not require training and which conform to the cultural practice of human beings. <??>In the present invention, no apparatus that obtains an analysis target is put off human body, and a normal sound is not an analysis target. A stethoscope-type microphone is installed on the surface of the human skin. Then, a vibration sound is sampled which is obtained when a non-audible murmur articulated in association with speech action (the motion of the mouth) not using the regular vibration of the vocal cords is transmitted through the flesh. A vibration sound obtained when a non-audible murmur amplified is transmitted through the flesh is similar to a whisper. The vibration sound can thus be heard and understood by human beings. Accordingly, the vibration sound can be used for a speech over the cellular phone as it is. Further, when the vibration sound obtained when the non-audible murmur is transmitted through the flesh is analyzed and converted into parameters, a kind of soundless recognition is realized. The present invention replaces the HMM model, conventionally used for speech recognition by an acoustic model created on the basis of a vibration sound obtained when a non-audible murmur is transmitted through the flesh.

An optimization method may be used to train the SSC, defining a table of weights (contributions to coefficients) to be used in the matrix equation representing the control law the solution yielding a control output to the plant. Sampling plant outputs, during training, may be done at a selected spatial frequency in state space (each dimension a variable from the control law).

The combinations are screened for high penetration but low irritation potential using a unique data mining method to find new potent and safe chemical penetration enhancer combinations. The members of a library of chemical penetration enhancer combinations are screened with a high throughput device to identify 'hot spots', particular combinations that show higher chemical penetration enhancement compared to neighboring compositions. The irritation potentials of the hot spot combinations are measured to identify combinations that also show low irritation potential. A active component, such as a drug, is then combined with the combination in a formulation which is tested for the ability of the drug to penetrate into or through skin. It is then assessed whether the formulation can deliver the quantity of drug required, and animal tests are conducted to confirm in vivo the ability of the chemical penetration enhancer combinations to facilitate transport of sufficient active molecules across the skin to achieve therapeutic levels of the active molecule in the animal's blood.

A sequence of input parameters, derived according to an application-specific algorithm, generates a corresponding sequence of memory addresses for these operations. The memory tables are organized in a hierarchical structure that corresponds to the input sequence. Table data is designed to recognize a specific library of input patterns. An input sequence traces an input-specific path through the memory tables until one of the patterns in the library is recognized (578) or until it is determined that the input sequence is inconsistent with any of the library patterns. For each library pattern, the table data is designed to accommodate the variations in the input values that are specific to the application (e.g., variations due to noise and/or tolerances). Table data can be derived by analysis, simulation, learning or a combination of these methods. The invention can replace neural networks or DSP correlation techniques in real-time applications. It achieves very high performance by comparing the input sequence to all of the patterns in the library simultaneously.
