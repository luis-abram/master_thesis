The steps of the method include collecting data elements having a range of values from the process. The number of data elements having values within predetermined intervals of the range are then counted. The counts of the data elements are applied as inputs to nodes of a neural network, each count being applied to a node representing the predetermined interval corresponding to the count. Output is then generated from the neural network based on the inputs, the output indicative of whether an error in the process (such as bias error or a precision error) has occurred. Several such neural networks such as one for every combination of error type and data type are employed. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, a moving window is used to collect a predetermined number of data elements each time. The steps of the method are then repeated after moving the window to replace a data element in the window with another data element outside the window. The method may also include scaling the data elements to values within a predetermined range before counting the data elements. This scaling step may comprise scaling the data elements to values within the range of zero to one, for example. When the method is applied to the process of laboratory analysis of patient speciments, the test results generated by a laboratory instrument are counted, and the counts are applied to the neural network. The neural network monitors trends in the test results to detect if the instrument is producing test results within an acceptable range. If test results outside of an acceptable range are detected, the neural network output indicates that an error has occured. The output is generated in real time and available immediately for automatic or manual correction of the instrument.

L-DNN technology uses a representation-rich, DNN- based subsystem with a fast-learning subsystem to learn new features quickly without forgetting previously learned features. Compared to a conventional DNN, L-DNN uses much less data to build robust networks, has dramatically shorter training time, and learns on-device instead of on servers without re-training or storing data. An edge device with L-DNN can learn continuously after deployment, eliminating costs in data collection and annotation, memory, and compute power.

The invention includes an innovative platform for an automated reorganization of knowledge, where the system automatically filters, slices, maps and links fragments of the initial files onto a modular structure of knowledge. Eventually, the system virtually substitutes the initial source files by content-files, where all of the relevant fragments from all relevant source-files are automatically integrated and hung onto the relevant node of a modular structure of knowledge. From the user's viewpoint, the new invention offers to substitute the concept of 'search' by the concept of 'mapping', such that instead of running Boolean searches, the user is guided to the relevant pieces of information via a map of links, which reflects the modular structure of the relevant field of knowledge. Because each node is linked to a content-file, the user is further guided to relevant fragments of information, with no need to engage in time consuming costly search-processes.",G06N 5/02,"E-BASE LTD.; HAVIV-SEGAL, Irit; VINER, Amir","HAVIV-SEGAL, Irit; VINER, Amir","60/199,008 19.04.2000 US; 60/226,694 22.08.2000 US",EP-2001923952
