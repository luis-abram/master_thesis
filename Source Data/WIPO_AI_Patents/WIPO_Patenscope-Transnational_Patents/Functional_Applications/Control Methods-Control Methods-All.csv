The off-line optimization is done without supervised learning so that desired outputs of neural network do not need to be available, and separate optimization to generate the desired outputs is not necessary. The off-line optimization can also rely on optimization criteria that are arbitrary: differentiability, convexity, even continuity of criteria are not required. The off-line optimization ensures robustness of generated controller parameters so that the input process characteristics do not need to be highly accurate. The off-line optimization is performed in such a way that the input parameters that relate to desired closed-loop system behavior include robustness parameters that can be used to effect tradeoffs between robust and nominal performance.

A first set of input parameters can include parameters that relate to process characteristics. A second set of input parameters can include parameters that relate to desired closed-loop system behavior.

The corresponding set of output vectors (O'1 to O'n) provided by the network (2) are compared to a target set of output vectors (O1 to On) by an error logger (12) which provides to the controller (10) a measure of similarity of the two sets. The controller (10) is arranged to alter the dynamic parameters independence on the average number of occasions the output vectors are different from the respective target output vectors. Measuring the similarity of the whole of the output set and target set and adjusting the parameters on this global measure rather than on the similarity of pairs of individual vectors provides enhanced training rates for neural networks having a data throughput rate that can be higher than the rate at which the parameters can be adjusted.,G06N 3/067,"BRITISH TELECOMMUNICATIONS PUBLIC LIMITED COMPANY; WOOD, David, Charles","WOOD, David, Charles",9024332.0 08.11.1990 GB,EP-1991919735; CA-2095720

In the method, a recurrent neuronal network is used for modelling the dynamic behaviour of the technical system, the input layer of which contains states of the technical system and actions carried out on the technical system, which are supplied to a recurrent hidden layer. The output layer of the recurrent neuronal network is represented by an evaluation signal which reproduces the dynamics of technical system. Optionally, only the state or action variables of the states of the technical system or of the actions carried out on the technical system that influence the evaluation signal can be used as states of the output layer. The hidden states generated using said recurrent neural network are used to control the technical system on the basis of a learning and/or optimization method. The method according to the invention has the advantage that the dimension of the state space of the recurrent hidden layer can be reduced in a suitable way and, nevertheless, the dynamics of the technical system can be modelled well.

On the basis of these actions (a), a numerical optimization method and, in particular, particle swarm optimization are then used to search for actions (a) which are better than the original actions according to an optimization criterion. If such actions (a) are found, the technical system is regulated or controlled on the basis of these new actions (a), that is to say the corresponding actions (a) are applied to the technical system in succession. The method according to the invention is suitable, in particular, for regulating or controlling a gas turbine, wherein the actions (a) are preferably optimized with respect to the criterion of low pollutant emission or low combustion chamber humming.

The present invention operates on mechanical parts described as solid models. The process employs well-defined solid models of the part to be machined and the raw stock from which it will be machined. The volumetric difference between the stock and the part defines the material (delta volumes) that must be cut away during the actual machining process. Delta volumes are solid models, and users (or an expert system) can subdivide delta volumes into smaller volumes that are consistent with a manufacturing process plan. A delta volume and a user-defined strategy for machining the delta volume are then input to NC algorithms. The algorithms generate NC tool paths that remove as much delta volume material as possible. Tool volumes are automatically generated from NC tool paths to represent the volume traversed by the cutting tool. By subtracting the tool volume from the delta volume, the material that remains to be machined is modeled and stored as new delta volumes. The subtraction of the tool volume from the stock defines a new stock model that represents the incremental change in stock when the NC tool path is processed at the machine tool. The process is repeated until all delta volumes have been machined and the part has been manufactured. <IMAGE>",B23Q 15/00; G05B 19/4097; G06F 17/50,SPATIAL TECHNOLOGY INC,SOWAR RICHARD M; HEINY WILLIAM C; OLSEN PAUL C; HOTCHKISS MARK R; DIXON THOMAS L; RICHARD CHARLES W JR; RAINES MICHAEL D,66994391 15.03.1991 US,

The codesign system outputs a description of the required processor (which can be in the form of a net list for placement on the FPGA), machine code to run on the processor, and a net list or register transfer level description of the necessary hardware. It is possible for the user to write some parts of the description of the target system at register transfer level to give closer control over the operation of the target system, and the user can specify theprocessor or processors to be used, and can change, for instance, the partitioner, compilers or speed estimators used in the codesign system.

In this way, each angular position of the target has a unique signature, which the radar system can determine and use to resolve the angular ambiguities.

The apparatus comprises a first unit for controlling a steering angle of one of the wheel pairs, a second unit for controlling braking forces to be applied to left and right wheels of at least one of the wheel pairs, and a third unit coupled to the sensor means for controlling the first and second units. The third unit calculates a target value for a dynamic parameter related to a motion of the vehicle based upon the sensed vehicle operating conditions. The third unit controls the first unit to bring the dynamic parameter to the target value. In the presence of vehicle braking. the third unit calculates changes in cornering powers of the respective wheel pairs and controls the second unit to provide a difference between the braking force applied to the left wheel and the braking force applied to the right wheel so as to cancel an influence of the cornering power changes on the dynamic parameter. <IMAGE>",B62D 9/00; B62D 15/00; B62D 6/00; B60T 8/1755; B62D 6/04; B62D 7/15; B62D 101/00; B62D 109/00; B62D 113/00; B62D 125/00; G05D 1/08,NISSAN MOTOR,YASUNO YOSHIKI; ITO KEN,24602790 18.09.1990 JP,
