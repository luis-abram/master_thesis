It can then be determined, using a binary classifier having at least one machine learning model trained using a plurality of images of known objects, whether each proposed bounding polygon encapsulates an object.

Further, the image data within each bounding polygon that is determined to encapsulate an object is provided to a second object classifier having at least one machine learning model trained using a plurality of images of known objects, to classify the object encapsulated within the respective bounding polygon.

Generally, for better training, the training data should be as large as possible. Unfortunately, manually tagging images is time consuming and susceptible to error, making it difficult to produce the large sets of tagged data used to train artificial neural networks. To address this problem, the inventors have developed a smart tagging utility that uses a feature extraction unit and a fast-learning classifier to learn tags and tag images automatically, reducing the time to tag large sets of data. The feature extraction unit and fast-learning classifiers can be implemented as artificial neural networks that associate a label with features extracted from an image and tag similar features from the image or other images with the same label. Moreover, the smart tagging system can learn from user adjustment to its proposed tagging.

The accuracy of the acoustic modelling is quantified by the rank of the correct phone. The invention includes a microphone for converting an utterance into an electrical signal. The signal from the microphone is processed by an acoustic processor and label match which finds the best-matched acoustic label prototype from the acoustic label prototype store. A probability distribution on phone boundaries is then produced for every time frame using the first decision tree described in the invention. These probabilities are compared to a threshold and some time frames are identified as boundaries between phones. An acoustic score is computed, for all phones between every given pair of hypothesized boundaries, and the phones are ranked on the basis of this score. The second decision tree is traversed for every time frame to obtain the worst case rank of the correct phone at that time, and using the phone score and phone rank computed in, a shortlist of allowed phones is made up for every time frame. This information is used to select a subset of acoustic word models in store, and a fast acoustic word match processor matches the label string from the acoustic processor against this subset of abridged acoustic word models to produce an utterance signal. The utterance signal output by the fast acoustic word match processor comprises of at least one word. In general, however, the fast acoustic word match processor will output a number of candidate words. Each word signal produced by the fast acoustic word match processor is input into a word context match which compares the word context to language models in store and outputs at least one candidate word. From the recognition candidates produced by the fast acoustic match and the language model, the detailed acoustic match matches the label string from the acoustic processor against detailed acoustic word models in store and outputs a word string corresponding to an utterance. <IMAGE>",G10L 15/00; G10L 15/02; G10L 15/04; G10L 15/14,IBM,NAHAMOO DAVID; PADMANABHAN MUKUND,34701394 30.11.1994 US,

Rule based intelligence is applied to the operations set and/or one or more operation choice set by a set of rules associated with its respective operation and/or choice set. When one or more rules in a rule set are applied to the operation set, an offered operation set is created which is a subset of the operation set. Only the operations in the offered operation set are offered to the user. When one or more rules in a rule set are applied to a choice set, an offered choice set is created which is a subset of the choice set. Only those operation choices in the offered choice set are offered to the user. The operations (operation choices) that are in the offered operation set (offered choice set) are those that conform to the constraints of the rules that are applied. The user selects operations (operation choices) from the offered operation set (offered choice set). Information about the user selections feeds back to the rules and is used to constrain the next offered operations and operation choices. The user is also permitted to change rules, rule specific metadata, and rule specific metadata algorithms as well as the data in the system. Interacting with the system this way, the user preference, knowledge, and judgment is incorporated in each of a series of interim results and is used to further develop the next interim result in the series of iterations. <IMAGE>   <IMAGE>",G06F 3/14; G06F 3/048; G06F 9/44; G06N 5/02; G06N 5/04,IBM,ROGOWITZ BERNICE ELLEN; RABENHORST DAVID ALEN; TREINISH LLOYD ALAN,19188294 03.02.1994 US,
