The B-tree is arranged in a hierarchy, with each node pointing to two nodes in the level below. Each node contains a test value (a word), and data relating to that test value (or a reference to a storage location where the data is maintained). The data is accessed by starting at the top of the tree and comparing the desired word with the test value for that node. Depending on the relative alphabetical ordering of the desired word and the test value, the appropriate branch from that node is followed. This process is continued down the tree until a test value corresponding to the desired word is located. The B-tree is arranged so that frequency of occurrence of the test values in natural language decreases substantially monotonically as the tree is descended. <IMAGE>",G06F 15/38; G06F 15/419; G06F 17/27; G06F 17/28; G06F 17/30,IBM,SHARMAN RICHARD,9308240 21.04.1993 GB,

The central concept is to define a potential energy of a collection of memory sites. Then each memory site is an attractor of other memory sites. With the proper definition of attractive and repulsive potentials between various memory sites, it is possible to minimize the energy of the collection of memories. By this method, internal representations may be ""built-up"" one layer at a time. Following the method of Bachmann et. al. a system is considered in which memories of events have already been recorded in a layer of cells. A method is found for the consolidation of the number of memories required to correctly represent the pattern environment. This method is shown to be applicable to a supervised learning paradigm in which pairs of input and output patterns are presented sequentially to the network. The resulting learning procedure develops internal representations in an incremental or cumulative fashion, from the layer closest to the input, to the output layer.",G06F 15/18; G06N 3/04; G06N 3/08; G06N 99/00,NESTOR INC,SCOFIELD CHRISTOPHER L,14563088 19.01.1988 US,

The first step (2) of the method (1) is to import an email document (3) to be parsed. In the preprocessing step (10) the email (3) is processed to determine the presence of any header text (5) (excluding any header text that may be within the embedded reply chain) or attachments 4, including attached email documents, if any. Once the header text (5), attachments (4) or other forwarded materials have been identified in the preprocessing step (10), these components of the email (3) are categorized by the computer (51) as non-author composed text. Next the process flow of the parsing computer (51) moves to the step of normalization (11). This entails processing the email document (3) to ascertain whether it is in a preferred format and, if the email document (3) is not in the preferred format, converting at least some of the information within the email document to the preferred format. The parsing computer (51) now progresses through several analysis steps, referred to as the segmentation step (12), the linguistic analysis step (13) and the punctuation analysis step (14). The results of these analysis steps (12) to (14) are recorded in suitable memory or storage means accessible to the CPU of the parsing computer (51). In the segmentation step (12) the text of email (3) is split into paragraphs, and the paragraphs are split into sentences. The linguistic analysis step (13) includes identification of predefined words and phrases of various types. In the punctuation analysis step (14) the parsing computer (51) analyses the text at the character level so as to check for use of sentence punctuation marks and other predefined characters. At the completion of the analysis steps (12) to (14), the process flow proceeds to step (15), in which the analysed email document, including any annotations that have been inserted, is saved into the memory of the computing pparatus, along with any extraneous results of the analysis. Next a number of features are defined at step (18). Typically, a feature is a descriptive statistic calculated from either or both of the raw text and the annotations. At step (19) the features extracted at step (18) are converted into data structures associated with segments of the text. At step (20) the machine learning system receives the data structures and associated lines of text as input and is responsive to that input so as to categorise each line of text as broadly falling into one of two categories: author composed text or non- author composed text.",G06F 17/30,"APPEN PTY LIMITED; HUTCHINSON, Ben; GAUSTAD, Tanja; ESTIVAL, Dominique; RADFORD, Wil; PHAM, Son, Bao","HUTCHINSON, Ben; GAUSTAD, Tanja; ESTIVAL, Dominique; RADFORD, Wil; PHAM, Son, Bao",2006906095 03.11.2006 AU; 2006906623 28.11.2006 AU,AU-2007314123; EP-2007718687; US-12447898

The input sentence, in the form of a string of words separated by blanks, is first analyzed (parsed) by a rule component that has access only to morphological and syntactic information about the words. The output of this rule component, in the form of a data structure consisting of attribute-value pairs, is then processed by the argument-structure component, which consists of a set of partially ordered procedures that incorporate further linguistic knowledge. The output of these procedures is the same attribute-value structure, now enhanced by the presence of semantic (i.e., meaningful, non-syntactic) attributes. These semantic attributes, taken together, form the argument structure of the input sentence. The resulting invention constitutes a fully modular, comprehensive and efficient method for passing from syntax to the first stage of semantic processing of natural (human) language. The invention applies to all prose sentences of the language for which it is designed, and not just to a subset of those sentences. It does not use domain-specific semantic information to improve the accuracy or efficiency of the syntactic component.

The descriptors define instructions for performing a pass of a DNN by the DNN processor. Several types of descriptors can be utilized: memory-to-memory move (M2M) descriptors; operation descriptors; host communication descriptors; configuration descriptors; branch descriptors; and synchronization descriptors. A DMA engine uses M2M descriptors to perform multi-dimensional strided DMA operations. Operation descriptors define the type of operation to be performed by neurons in the DNN processor and the activation function to be used by the neurons. M2M descriptors are buffered separately from operation descriptors and can be executed at soon as possible, subject to explicitly set dependencies. As a result, latency can be reduced and, consequently, neurons can complete their processing faster. The DNN module can then be powered down earlier than it otherwise would have, thereby saving power.",G06N 3/063,"MICROSOFT TECHNOLOGY LICENSING, LLC","AMBARDEKAR, Amol Ashok; CEDOLA, Kent D.; WALL, Larry Marvin; BOBROV, Boris; PETRE, George; MCBRIDE, Chad Balling","62/486,432 17.04.2017 US; 15/951,106 11.04.2018 US",CN-201880025508.3; EP-2018721665

The apparatus includes feed-forward (30-14...30-17) and feed-back (32-41...32-71) synaptic connection circuits whose respective couplings are weighted according to values stored on capacitors in each connection circuit. A learning algorithm strengthens connections in both directions between particular ones of first level (16-1...16-3) and second level neurons (18-4...18-7) to the extent of concurrence of high activity levels in both, and weakens same to the extent of concurrence of high activity level in the second level neuron (18-4...18-7) and a low activity level in the first level neuron (16-1...16-3). A sleep mode disconnects all environmental inputs (22-1...22-3) and provides non-specific low activity level signals to each first level neuron (16-1...16-3), causing the network to randomly traverse its state space and accomplishing refresh as the learning algorithm remains active.

The method is distinguished from existing training methods for RNNs through the following characteristics: (1) Only the weights of connections to output units are changed by learning - existing methods for teaching recurrent networks adjust all network weights.

Each context identifier is a logical combination of choices, with each choice identifying one of the disjuncts of a disjunction in the system. Each choice can include a disjunction identifier and a choice identifier identifying one of the disjuncts of the identified disjunction. The logical combination of choices in a context identifier thus corresponds to a combination of disjuncts, all of which could be from different disjunctions. If two data units have context identifiers identifying contexts that are genuine alternatives, those data units are not unified. Data units that have context identifiers that are not genuine alternatives are unified. A set of context-value pairs, referred to as a disjunctive value, can be unified with another disjunctive value by considering all combinations of pairs of context identifiers that include one context identifier from each disjunctive value. The number of combinations of context identifiers in each disjunctive value is reduced by combining context-value pairs: Pairs with equal value tokens are combined by merging their context identifiers and unifying the value tokens. Pairs with f-structures as values are combined by merging context identifiers and unifying the f-structures. An equality within a disjunct is handled by unifying the equated entities, but only in the context appropriate to that disjunct. If it is necessary to insert a pointer, the pointer is inserted so that it initially leads to a disjunctive value, with the source of the pointer indicating which of the context-value pairs in the disjunctive value is to be accessed.

The weighting factor used in the interpolation is based on the probability that the presence of the feature is independent of the given class. In one embodiment, this weighting factor is calculated as the chi-square probability that the observed association between the presence of the feature and the class is due to chance. The subject algorithm incorporated into the Bayesian classifier may be used to provide more accurate estimates of the so-called likelihood probabilities used by the Bayesian classifier, thus to allow the Bayesian classifier to perform more accurate classifications, with the Bayesian classifier being used for numerous applications in natural language processing and other fields. In one embodiment, the Bayesian classifier is applied to the natural-language processing task of correcting textual errors in which an incorrect word was inadvertently substituted for a correct word within a sentence. <IMAGE>",G06F 17/18; G06F 17/10; G06F 7/24; G06F 17/30; G06F 17/10; G06F 17/18,MITSUBISHI ELECTRIC CORP,GOLDING ANDREW R,17428498 16.10.1998 US,

It comprises mapping logical forms to a set of Initial Trees. The structure and overall content of these trees is such as to be usable as the input to a parser for natural language analysis. Each tree has a set of syntactic features, that is, pairs of attributes and their values. A grammar is applied to the Initial Trees, in order to build a syntactic tree, whereby said Initial Trees are parsed as an unordered set of complex symbols. Each grammar rule is partly a phrase structure recognition rule and partly a specification of the translation of a node built up by the rule. The syntactic tree thus produced are evaluated, and translation strings are created by mapping all Initial Trees to (possibly null) natural language strings, as a function of their categories and the features which the grammar and the Initial Tree generator has placed on them. Also an apparatus for carrying out the method of paraphrasing logical forms of natural language expressions is disclosed. <IMAGE>",G06F 15/38; G06F 17/27; G06F 17/28,IBM,WHITE BRIAN FREDERICK; BRETAN IVAN PAUL; SANAMRAD MOHAMMAD ALI,90850295 04.09.1990 EP,

Many of the proteins that are involved in the metabolism, disposition and elimination of drugs are members of multigene families that exhibit very marked species differences in gene number, function and regulation. For these reasons, experiments carried out in laboratory animals to establish routes of metabolism or toxicity can be severely compromised and, as a consequence, do not faithfully represent the human situation.

Representing of texts in the concept-space derived from Wikipedia has received growing attention recently, due to its comprehensiveness and expertise. This concept-based representation is capable of extracting semantic relatedness between texts that cannot be deduced with the bag of words model. A key obstacle, however, for using Wikipedia as a semantic interpreter is that the sheer size of the concepts derived from Wikipedia makes it hard to efficiently map texts into concept-space. An efficient algorithm is proved which is able to represent the meaning of a text by using the concepts that best match it. In particular, this approach first computes the approximate top- concepts that are most relevant to the given text.
