This model first screens genes to reduce noise, applies k-means correlation-based clustering, and then uses singular-value decompositions to extract the single dominant factor (principal component) from each cluster. This generates a statistically significant number of cluster-derived singular factors, that we refer to as metagenes, which characterize multiple patterns of expression of the genes across samples. The strategy aims to extract multiple such patterns while reducing dimension and smoothing out gene­specific noise through the aggregation within clusters. Formal predictive analysis then uses these metagenes in a Bayesian classification tree analysis. This generates multiple recursive partitions of the sample into subgroups ('leaves' of the tree), and associates Bayesian predictive probabilities of outcomes with each subgroup. Overall predictions for an individual sample are then generated by averaging predictions, with appropriate weights, across many such tree models.

Using customer data a Bayesian statistical model is generated and this model used to generate statistical estimators of customer behaviour. The statistical model is formed using hidden Markov model techniques by clustering customer data and attributes (e.g. Age, sex, salary) into a finite number of states. The number of states is unobserved and considered random. Bayesian prior probability distributions are specified and combined with the data to produce Bayesian posterior probability distributions.

The digital neuron comprises an n bit input one bit output device utilising a random access memory having 2<n> locations of one bit each. The neuron is programmed by the network training algorithm with the neuron fire state (on or off) in accordance with the synaptic weights allocated to the input code combination pattern for that neuron within the neural network. The digital neuron operates as a look-up table device deriving the neuron firing state, for each n bit digital code pattern applied to its input paths, from the random access memory location identified by the digital code pattern. The synaptic weights allocated to each digital code pattern for a particular neuron in the network cause the neuron to provide as an input correlation function or an interconnect function. The network architecture is based upon digital neurons providing either correlation or interconnection functions allowing a reduced interconnection arrangement where the output of each neuron in the input and hidden layers is connected only to an input path of a corresponding or immediately above or below neuron in the next layer.

The techniques are particularly useful for programs having class predicates and subclass predicates which are definitive of a class/sub-class hierarchy, such as the case with PROLOG's application in object-oriented programming systems, expert systems, object-oriented databases, object-oriented deductive databases, knowledge representations, etc. The techniques ensure that searching within the type hierarchy takes precedence over searching of instances of types. Important to accomplishing this function is the pre-assigning of ranks to predicates and clauses within the program to be processed. Query processing on the program is then based upon the pre-assigned predicate and clause rankings. In particular, novel rules are substituted for conventional predicate and clause selection rules of PROLOG interpreters such that predicates and clauses are preferably processed in order of ranking. In addition, certain query processing simplification steps are introduced. The net effect is a technique which eliminates redundant and unnecessary searching at the instance level by taking advantage of information available in the type lattice. <IMAGE>",G06F 9/44; G06F 12/00; G06F 17/30; G06N 5/00,IBM,"DALAL, MUKESH; GANGOPADHYAY, DIPAYAN",80132391 02.12.1991 US,

The computer system uses T to hill climb from the initial fault hierarchy KB0, through successive hierarchies, KB1... KBm, with successively higher empirical accuracies over C. At each stage, to go from a fault hierarchy KBk to its neighbor KBk+1, the computer system must evaluate KBk's accuracy over C, as well as the accuracy of each KB'  ELEMENT  N(KBk). The computer system provides an efficient way of evaluating the accuracy of KBk, and each &thetas;i(KBk), towards determining which, if any, &thetas;i(KBk) is more accurate than KBk. It exploits a few key observations. First, as each transformation used to map one hierarchy to a related one performs only local changes to the hierarchy, it will have only minor and easily computed effects on any instance. Second, most transformations will have no effect on many instances. Finally, one can bound how much the accuracy score for a knowledge base can change based on any instance, which means branch-and-bound techniques can be used to avoid computing the accuracy scores for various hierarchies that cannot be optimal. <IMAGE>",G06N 5/00; G06N 5/02,SIEMENS CORP RES INC,GREINER RUSSELL; RAO R BHARAT; MEREDITH GLENN A,58462996 10.01.1996 US,

The system has a set of one or more operations. Each of these operations in turn has a set of one or more choices, called a choice set, associated with an operation. Rule based intelligence is applied to the operations set and/or one or more operation choice set by a set of rules associated with its respective operation and/or choice set. When one or more rules in a rule set are applied to the operation set, an offered operation set is created which is a subset of the operation set. Only the operations in the offered operation set are offered to the user. When one or more rules in a rule set are applied to a choice set, an offered choice set is created which is a subset of the choice set. Only those operation choices in the offered choice set are offered to the user. The operations (operation choices) that are in the offered operation set (offered choice set) are those that conform to the constraints of the rules that are applied. The user selects operations (operation choices) from the offered operation set (offered choice set). Information about the user selections feeds back to the rules and is used to constrain the next offered operations and operation choices. The user is also permitted to change rules, rule specific metadata, and rule specific metadata algorithms as well as the data in the system. Interacting with the system this way, the user preference, knowledge, and judgment is incorporated in each of a series of interim results and is used to further develop the next interim result in the series of iterations. <IMAGE>   <IMAGE>",G06F 3/14; G06F 3/048; G06F 9/44; G06N 5/02; G06N 5/04,IBM,ROGOWITZ BERNICE ELLEN; RABENHORST DAVID ALEN; TREINISH LLOYD ALAN,19188294 03.02.1994 US,
