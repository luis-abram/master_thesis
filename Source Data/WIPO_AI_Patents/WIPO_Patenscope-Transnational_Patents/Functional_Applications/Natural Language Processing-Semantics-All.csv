The output probability associated with a state is determined by weighing the output probabilities of the context-dependent and context-independent states in accordance with a weighting factor. The weighting factor indicates the robustness of the output probability associated with each state of each model, especially in predicting unseen speech utterances. <IMAGE>",G10L 15/14; G10L 15/10; G06K 9/62; G10L 15/14; G10L 15/18,MICROSOFT CORP,HUANG XUEDONG D; MAHAJAN MILIND V,65527396 01.05.1996 US,

The savings, which reduce processing time both during the forward and the backward passes of the search, as well as during rescoring, are achieved by performing only the minimal amount of computation required to produce an exact N-best list of semantically meaningful words (N-best list of salient words). This departs from the standard Spoken Language System modeling which any notion of meaning is handled by the Natural Language Understanding (NLU) component. By expanding the task of the recognizer component from a simple acoustic match to allow semantic information to be fed to the recognizer, significant processing time savings are achieved, and make it possible to run an increased number of speech recognition channels in parallel for improved performance, which may enhance users perception of value and quality of service. <IMAGE>",G10L 15/08; G10L 15/18,NORTEL NETWORKS LTD,CRESPO JEAN-FRANCOIS; STUBLEY PETER R; ROBILLARD SERGE,11962198 21.07.1998 US; 18552998 04.11.1998 US,

The pixels in the remaining image are assigned object classes without segmenting the remainder of the image into objects. After the small portion is segmented into object classes, characteristics of object classes are determined. The pixelwise descriptors describe which pixels are associated with particular object classes by matching the characteristics of object classes to the comparison between pixels at predetermined offsets. A pixel heat map is generated by giving each pixel the color assigned to the object class that the pixelwise descriptors indicate is most probably associated with that pixel.",G06K 9/00; G06K 9/46; G06K 9/62,DEFINIENS AG,PAULY OLIVIER; BRIEU NICOLAS; SCHMIDT GÜNTER; ZIMMERMANN JOHANNES; BINNIG GERD,201414473096 29.08.2014 US,

At the second level are rules that generate the efficient testing rules for each pure subsystem. The second level rules can be compared to a node evaluation function in a typical problem of searching a graph to select the best node for expansion from a current list of candidate nodes, so that the best path to the correct system diagnosis is found in the shortest amount of time using a minimum of user input. Two heuristic rules are applied to speed-up the process of selecting the node as the best candidate for expansion.

The so determined image feature information is fused into a new image. This process is also called an image fusion (IF). A spatio-temporal tracking of an object of the new image is enabled by using a probabilistic graphical model (PGM). The probabilistic graphical model (PGM) can be modified by a hierarchical modelling or order decoupling. Furthermore specific boundary conditions can be defined to adapt the probabilistic graphical model (PGM). The new fused image comprises an increased information density thanks to the image fusion (IF). This preferably leads to a new image with increased information density. It usually allows for an improved modelling within the probabilistic graphical model (PGM) and improved spatio-temporal tracking of objects.,G06T 7/20; G06T 7/277,CONNAUGHT ELECTRONICS LTD.,"YOGAMANI, Senthil",10 2018 100 667.5 12.01.2018 DE,

The database is formed based on a training string utterance signal and a plurality of sets of current speech recognition models. The sets of current speech recognition models may include acoustic models, language models, and other knowledge sources. In accordance with an illustrative embodiment of the invention, a set of confusable string models is generated, each confusable string model comprising speech recognition models from two or more sets of speech recognition models (such as acoustic and language models). A first scoring signal is generated based on the training string utterance signal and a string model for that utterance, wherein the string model for the utterance comprises speech recognition models from two or more sets of speech recognition models. One or more second scoring signals are also generated, wherein a second scoring signal is based on the training string utterance signal and a confusable string model. A misrecognition signal is generated based on the first scoring signal and the one or more second scoring signals. Current speech recognition models are modified, based on the misrecognition signal to increase the probability that a correct string model will have a rank order higher than other confusable string models. The confusable string models comprise N-best word string models. The first recognizer scoring signal reflects a measure of similarity between the training string utterance signal and the string model for that utterance. The second recognizer scoring signal reflects a measure of similarity between the training string utterance signal and a confusable string model. The misrecognition signal reflects a difference of the first scoring signal and a combination of one or more second scoring signals. The modification of current speech recognition models is accomplished by generating a recognition model modification signal according to a gradient of a function, which function reflects a recognizer score of a training string utterance based on a string model for that utterance and one or more recognizer scores of the training string utterance based on one or more confusable string models. <IMAGE>",G10L 7/08; G10L 5/06; G10L 15/06; G10L 9/06; G10L 15/14; G10L 9/18; G10L 15/28,AT & T CORP,CHOU WU; JUANG BIING-HWANG; LEE CHIN-HUI,9614293 22.07.1993 US,

Once a feature sequence is extracted from the signal, pattern classification is performed to determine if the extracted feature sequence is associated with one or more heart beats. The pattern classification may include finding the optimal state sequence by calculating the probability of each allowable state sequence based on the extracted feature sequence and heart beat models or additional noise models. Another pattern classification technique may determine a heart beat candidate using frame energy and dynamic thresholding methods followed by computing the probabilities between the feature sequence and each stored heart beat model or additional noise models.

The data structure is produced and maintained using a grammar of textual types, indicating for each textual type the textual types of units into which it can properly be divided. During editing, a text sequence is generated by applying rendering rules to the data structure, and the text is presented to the user based on the text sequence. Prior to generating the text sequence, information relating to punctuational features is propagated through the data structure. User signals requesting editing operation are applied to modify the data structure using operations rules, and the user's pointing or selecting signals are mapped onto the data structure.

The system has a set of one or more operations. Each of these operations in turn has a set of one or more choices, called a choice set, associated with an operation. Rule based intelligence is applied to the operations set and/or one or more operation choice set by a set of rules associated with its respective operation and/or choice set. When one or more rules in a rule set are applied to the operation set, an offered operation set is created which is a subset of the operation set. Only the operations in the offered operation set are offered to the user. When one or more rules in a rule set are applied to a choice set, an offered choice set is created which is a subset of the choice set. Only those operation choices in the offered choice set are offered to the user. The operations (operation choices) that are in the offered operation set (offered choice set) are those that conform to the constraints of the rules that are applied. The user selects operations (operation choices) from the offered operation set (offered choice set). Information about the user selections feeds back to the rules and is used to constrain the next offered operations and operation choices. The user is also permitted to change rules, rule specific metadata, and rule specific metadata algorithms as well as the data in the system.

Each context identifier is a logical combination of choices, with each choice identifying one of the disjuncts of a disjunction in the system. Each choice can include a disjunction identifier and a choice identifier identifying one of the disjuncts of the identified disjunction. The logical combination of choices in a context identifier thus corresponds to a combination of disjuncts, all of which could be from different disjunctions. If two data units have context identifiers identifying contexts that are genuine alternatives, those data units are not unified. Data units that have context identifiers that are not genuine alternatives are unified. A set of context-value pairs, referred to as a disjunctive value, can be unified with another disjunctive value by considering all combinations of pairs of context identifiers that include one context identifier from each disjunctive value. The number of combinations of context identifiers in each disjunctive value is reduced by combining context-value pairs: Pairs with equal value tokens are combined by merging their context identifiers and unifying the value tokens. Pairs with f-structures as values are combined by merging context identifiers and unifying the f-structures. An equality within a disjunct is handled by unifying the equated entities, but only in the context appropriate to that disjunct. If it is necessary to insert a pointer, the pointer is inserted so that it initially leads to a disjunctive value, with the source of the pointer indicating which of the context-value pairs in the disjunctive value is to be accessed.

The system works as an information system through which the user is able to add many levels of dimensions in and above an information space, and at the same time is able to explore, search, view and in other ways work upon the different dimensions and combinations of dimensions of information in the information space. The system is able to work upon information existing within the computer environment, information existing outside the computer environment, information inputted into the system, information derived from other information. Through this system, information from diverse sources can be structurised, managed, organised, associated, meta, contextualised, searched, explored, visualised and re-represented from a single platform. By utilising the concept of information spaces and information entities, which enables the system to create an environment where information spaces can be combined with a whole range of other concepts, the user is able to use many different metaphors to operate on information. These metaphors open up new possibilities for the ways the user can utilise and interact with the information environment, thus solving many problems users face when dealing with information in existing information systems, such as information overload, inability to easily correlate information, limitations due to information locality, inability to flexibly organise information within strict hierarchies, inability to express user ideas on any information. Strategic and flexible combinations of these metaphors when implemented in various embodiments of the present invention can thus enable users to operate on information within computer systems as if a natural extension of their ideas, rather than separate information stores. In one embodiment, the system is able to act as an information augmentation platform, where the user by using tools provided can express much more information upon existing information in available domains. In another example, the system is able to act as an information re-representer, where existing user information can be re-represented to express different, and often hidden, aspects of the information. In another example, the system is able to act as a common information management platform, where the user is able to consolidate different types of information required for a project or task from a multiplicity of sources into one common place, where this information can be structured and accessed coherently with high relevancy. The possible uses of this system are possibly manifold. The present invention changes way people store, retrieve, understand and see their information or knowledge. Users can now create meaning above information, penning down ideas, comments and adding dimensions into or above the information space. Work processes can thus be more seamless and information is made much more holistic and all rounded. Instead of users trying to work within a previously limited information space, users are now able to work within an extended, multidimensional, augmentable information space which allows for much more expressibility, allowing users to express or work using any form of information or idea above or within any information, knowledge or aspect of the information space.",G06F 17/30; G06Q 10/00,"SOH, Eng, Lee; GOH, Koon, Yiak","SOH, Eng, Lee; GOH, Koon, Yiak",200900684-2 31.01.2009 SG,

More particularly the invention is related to a methodology of automatically deriving and steadily improving a process model executed by the WFMS. Current methodologies of defining process models are a priori in nature, i.e. it is assumed that the correct process model of a business process to be supported must be specified before workflow technology can be used to execute and control the underlying activities making up the business process. The current invention dramatically simplifies and automates the process of modeling a business model of a business process. The invention allows to start just with the set of unrelated activities and discover the real world relations between them at a later point in time; data mining and OLAP technologies are exploited for this discovery. The current invention thus proposes a posteriori methodology. For that purpose the precise underlying process model is derived at a later point in time based on audit data collected by the WFMS during the early deployment of a process model. <IMAGE>",G06F 17/60; G06Q 10/00,IBM,AGRAWAL RAKESH; LEYMANN FRANK DR; ROLLER DIETER,97113299 01.08.1997 EP; 98111410 22.06.1998 EP,
