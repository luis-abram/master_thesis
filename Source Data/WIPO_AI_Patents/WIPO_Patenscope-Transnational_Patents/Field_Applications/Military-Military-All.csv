Contemplated systems include many private data servers, each having local private data. Researchers can request that relevant private data servers train implementations of machine learning algorithms on their local private data without requiring de-identification of the private data or without exposing the private data to unauthorized computing systems. The private data servers also generate synthetic or proxy data according to the data distributions of the actual data. The servers then use the proxy data to train proxy models. When the proxy models are sufficiently similar to the trained actual models, the proxy data, proxy model parameters, or other learned knowledge can be transmitted to one or more non-private computing devices. The learned knowledge from many private data servers can then be aggregated into one or more trained global models without exposing private data.",G06N 99/00; G06N 5/04,"NANTOMICS, LLC; NANT HOLDINGS IP, LLC","SZETO, Christopher; BENZ, Stephen, Charles; WITCHEY, Nicholas, J.","62/363,697 18.07.2016 US",EP-2017831625; SG-11201900220R; KR-1020197004647; MX-MX/a/2019/000713; AU-2017300259; IL-264281; CA-3031067; JP-2019502045; CN-201780056525.9

In the punctuation analysis step (14) the parsing computer (51) analyses the text at the character level so as to check for use of sentence punctuation marks and other predefined characters. At the completion of the analysis steps (12) to (14), the process flow proceeds to step (15), in which the analysed email document, including any annotations that have been inserted, is saved into the memory of the computing pparatus, along with any extraneous results of the analysis. Next a number of features are defined at step (18). Typically, a feature is a descriptive statistic calculated from either or both of the raw text and the annotations. At step (19) the features extracted at step (18) are converted into data structures associated with segments of the text. At step (20) the machine learning system receives the data structures and associated lines of text as input and is responsive to that input so as to categorise each line of text as broadly falling into one of two categories: author composed text or non- author composed text.",G06F 17/30,"APPEN PTY LIMITED; HUTCHINSON, Ben; GAUSTAD, Tanja; ESTIVAL, Dominique; RADFORD, Wil; PHAM, Son, Bao","HUTCHINSON, Ben; GAUSTAD, Tanja; ESTIVAL, Dominique; RADFORD, Wil; PHAM, Son, Bao",2006906095 03.11.2006 AU; 2006906623 28.11.2006 AU,AU-2007314123; EP-2007718687; US-12447898

The innovation of the approach relies on the frequency dependence of the tissue's electrical impedance which facilitates the acquisition of multiple thermal images with currents at different frequencies injected to the region of the body under inspection. Proposed method without current application (in passive mode of operation) provides images which are obtained by standard thermal imagers. On the other hand, the application of the electrical current (in active mode of operation) increases the temperature contrast on the body surface depending on the electrical property of tissue. Therefore, the technique while increasing the thermal contrast provides frequency dependent conductivity distribution data which can be used as a basis for the detection of the breast carcinoma.

The frequency at which the original function is called and the approximate model is updated is determined by the local fidelity of the approximate model. By local fidelity the fidelity of the model for the region where the current population is located is designated. The lower the model fidelity is, the more frequently the original function should be called and the approximate models should be updated. <IMAGE>",G06N 3/12; G06F 17/50; G05B 13/02; G06N 3/00; G06N 3/12,HONDA R & D EUROP DEUTSCHLAND,YAOCHU JIN; SENDHOFF BERNHARD DR,00124825 14.11.2000 EP,

The texture analysis of the bone structure incorporates directionality information, for example in terms of the angular dependence of the RMS variation and first moment of the power spectrum of a ROI in the bony region of interest. The system also includes using dual energy imaging in order to obtain measures of both mass and bone structure with one exam. Specific applications are given for the analysis of regions within the vertebral bodies on conventional spine radiographs. Techniques include novel features that characterize the power spectrum of the bone structure and allow extraction of directionality features with which to characterize the spatial distribution and thickness of the bone trabeculae. These features are then merged using artificial neural networks in order to yield a likelihood of risk of future fracture. In addition, a method and system is presented in which dual-energy imaging techniques are used to yield measures of both bone mass and bone structure with one low-dose radiographic examination; thus, making the system desirable for screening (for osteoporosis and risk of future fracture). <IMAGE>",G06F 19/00; A61B 6/00; G06F 19/00; G06T 7/00,ARCH DEV CORP,GIGER MARYELLEN L; DOI KUNIO,95903553 29.11.1994 EP; 15838893 29.11.1993 US,

The control can be based on the pose(s) and/or classification(s) directly, and/or based on movement parameter(s) for the object(s) 394 determined based on the pose(s) and/or classification(s). Pose(s) and/or classification(s) of environmental object(s) are determined based on data from a phase coherent Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) component 392 of the vehicle, such as a phase coherent LIDAR monopulse component and/or a frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) LIDAR component. Localization subsystem 152 is generally responsible for localizing a vehicle within its environment. Perception subsystem 154 is principally responsible for perceiving objects within the environment of the vehicle, and can utilize FMCW LIDAR data 392 and optionally data from other sensor(s) 391 (e.g., camera 140, RADAR component 134) to detect those objects, classify those objects, determine velocities for those objects, and track those objects.

If the processing device is a telephone, the objective may be to anticipate the phone numbers that a phone user will call. If the processing device is a television remote control, the objective may be to anticipate the television channels that will watched by the user. One of a plurality of actions (e.g., game actions, educational prompts, listed phone numbers, or listed television channels) to be performed on the processing device is selected. A user input indicative of a user action (e.g., a player action, educational input, called phone number, or watched television channel) is received. An outcome of the selected action and/or user action is determined. For example, in the case of a computer game, the outcome may indicate whether a computer-manipulated object has intersected a user-manipulated object.
