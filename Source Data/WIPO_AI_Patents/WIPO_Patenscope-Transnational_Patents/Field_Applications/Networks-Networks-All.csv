Based on the identified dependencies, the network analysis tool can discover functional relationships between network assets. For example, a network analysis tool receives network flow information, identifies dependencies between multiple network assets based on evaluation of the network flow information, and outputs results of the identification of the dependencies. When evaluating the network flow information, the network analysis tool can pre-process the network flow information to produce input vectors, use deep learning to extract patterns in the input vectors, and then determine dependencies based on the extracted patterns. The network analysis tool can repeat this process so as to update an assessment of the dependencies between network assets on a near real-time basis.",G06F 15/173,BATTELLE MEMORIAL INSTITUTE,"CARROLL, Thomas, E.; CHIKKAGOUDAR, Satish; EDGAR, Thomas, W.; OLER, Kiri, J.; ARTHUR-DURRETT, Kristine, M.; JOHNSON, Daniel, M.; KANGAS, Lars, J.","14/548,159 19.11.2014 US",

A device prioritization model can be trained employing machine learning to contextually understand when user devices tend to be most used in relation to a set of user devices in a local network. This may yield a more efficient use of network bandwidth, reducing the outlay requirements for network resources. Additionally, the model can adjust the prioritization of network traffic for different time periods (e.g., days of the week, times of the day, and holiday events, etc.). Additionally, by prioritization of devices, congestion that may occur when devices tend to synchronize overhead traffic is reduced, as the devices, based on the prioritization scheme, will end up reporting at different times. This results in a better utilization of available bandwidth. Example network-connected devices (116) include personal computers, mobile communication devices, entertainment centers (e.g., gaming systems), Internet-of- Things (loT) network-connected devices such as appliances (e.g., refrigerators, washing machines, coffee makers), medical devices (e.g., pacemakers, glucose monitors), building-monitoring devices (e.g., thermostats, security systems, cameras, smoke detectors), and other devices that can send and receive data over a local network (104) and the network (102).",H04L 12/28; G06F 19/00; H04L 29/08; H04L 12/24,GOOGLE LLC,"JACOBSON, Alex Daniel; EIDEM, Laura Marie","15/392,576 28.12.2016 US",CN-201780087618.8; EP-2017833061

Two major remaining obstacles to the widespread clinical use of NGS are the cost of supporting a team of geneticists and concerns over reproducibility of results. To address these concerns, a computer-based method and system is presented that automates the process of performing a genetic diagnosis by leveraging sequencing and phenotype data mined from thousands of patients. The resulting EXPERT system lists the probability that every mutant gene causes disease. Taking the highest scoring gene generates a genetic diagnosis identical to that of human experts 90% of the time, with differences occurring largely in unclear cases. In addition, the probability assigned to a gene by the EXPERT system is closely correlated with the subjective ""confidence"" of a prediction assigned by human experts examining the same patient.

Client requests for data items are processed by expansion rule logic to find an expansion rule set (e.g., file) corresponding to the identified data item. The rule set is used to expand requests for certain data items into expanded requests that return more data items than those requested. Client devices receive, cache and (often) use the cached expanded data items, which thereby reduces the overall number of requests to the data service. Expansion rules may be based upon observations (e.g., machine learned and/or manual) of request patterns, so as to reasonably predict which data item or items clients will likely next need, and return those as expanded data items in anticipation of their need.",G06F 17/30; H04N 21/43,"HOME BOX OFFICE, INC.","BUSAYARAT, Sata; GAY, Allen Arthur; FURTWANGLER, Brandon C.; FURTWANGLER, Steven N.","62/240,888 13.10.2015 US; 15/285,439 04.10.2016 US",MX-MX/a/2018/004690; SG-11201803215Q; CA-3002055; EP-2016787677
