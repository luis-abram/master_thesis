Once the header text (5), attachments (4) or other forwarded materials have been identified in the preprocessing step (10), these components of the email (3) are categorized by the computer (51) as non-author composed text.

This entails processing the email document (3) to ascertain whether it is in a preferred format and, if the email document (3) is not in the preferred format, converting at least some of the information within the email document to the preferred format. The parsing computer (51) now progresses through several analysis steps, referred to as the segmentation step (12), the linguistic analysis step (13) and the punctuation analysis step (14). The results of these analysis steps (12) to (14) are recorded in suitable memory or storage means accessible to the CPU of the parsing computer (51).

The linguistic analysis step (13) includes identification of predefined words and phrases of various types. In the punctuation analysis step (14) the parsing computer (51) analyses the text at the character level so as to check for use of sentence punctuation marks and other predefined characters. At the completion of the analysis steps (12) to (14), the process flow proceeds to step (15), in which the analysed email document, including any annotations that have been inserted, is saved into the memory of the computing pparatus, along with any extraneous results of the analysis. Next a number of features are defined at step (18). Typically, a feature is a descriptive statistic calculated from either or both of the raw text and the annotations. At step (19) the features extracted at step (18) are converted into data structures associated with segments of the text.

The stored acoustic models are formed by first recording a plurality of words by a plurality of children from a given list of single words. These recordings are then processed off-line to give a basic acoustic model of an acceptable or correct sound for each phoneme in the context of the pre- and proceeding phonemes. The acoustic models are Hidden Markov Models. The limits of acceptable prononciation applied to different words and children may be adjusted by variable penalty values applied in association with the general speech acoustic model.

Consequently, a lot of effort is dedicated to distinguishing between two or more similar classification objects, meaning that supervised learning procedures are slow and produce classifiers that are excessively large. Moreover, the classifiers are often difficult to understand, and take a long time to be generated. <??>Embodiments of the invention are concerned with reducing the number of classification values that can be used to classify a data item. Relationships between classification values are identified on the basis of attribute values in a set of training data, and those classification values that are determined to be related to one another are subsumed into a single classification group. <??>An embodiment of the invention is thus concerned with identifying groups of classification values corresponding to a set of data, where each data item in the set is characterised by a plurality of attributes, and each attribute has one of a plurality of attribute values associated therewith. The method comprises the steps of:  (i) selecting an attribute; (ii) identifying, on the basis of the distribution of attribute values, two classification values that are least similar to one another and allocating a first identified classification value to a first group and a second identified classification value to a second group; (iii) allocating each unidentified classification value to one of the groups in dependence on correlation between the unidentified classification value and the first and second identified classification values; (iv) evaluating an association between the first and second groups and the selected attribute; (v) repeating steps (i) to (iv) for each of at least some of the plurality of attributes (vi) comparing associations evaluated at step (iv) and selecting first and second groups corresponding to the weakest association; (vii) for each of the first and second groups repeating steps (i) to (vi) for the classification values therein, until the association evaluated at step (iv) falls below a predetermined threshold value.  <??>Essentially classification groups are repeatedly analysed with respect to a range of attributes so as to identify all possible groupings of classification values. For example, classification values Daily Mail, Daily Express, The Times, The Guardian, Vogue, New Scientist, Economist, Cosmopolitan, FHM, House and Garden are analysed with respect to a selection of attributes (e.g. sex, age, occupation etc.). Assuming that the analysis identifies the classification values as falling within two classification groups: ÄDaily Mail, Daily Express, Cosmopolitan, FHMÜ and ÄThe Times, The Guardian, Vogue, New Scientist, Economist, House and GardenÜ, each of these groups is then analysed with respect to the same, or a different, selection of attributes. This second round of analysis may identify further clusters of classification values - e.g. the analysis could show that the classification values in the latter group are clustered into two distinct groups: ÄHouse and Garden, VogueÜ and ÄThe Times, The Guardian, New Scientist, EconomistÜ. After each round of analysis an association between the groups and attributes is measured and is compared with a threshold; this comparison identifies whether or not the groups are sufficiently different as to justify splitting up the classification values into groups. <IMAGE>",G06F 17/30; G06F 17/30; G06K 9/62; G06K 9/68,BRITISH TELECOMM,,02252733 18.04.2002 EP,

Consequently, a lot of effort is dedicated to distinguishing between two or more similar classification objects, meaning that supervised learning procedures are slow and produce classifiers that are excessively large. Moreover, the classifiers are often difficult to understand, and take a long time to be generated. Embodiments of the invention are concerned with reducing the number of classification values that can be used to classify a data item. Relationships between classification values are identified on the basis of attribute values in a set of training data, and those classification values that are determined to be related to one another are subsumed into a single classification group. An embodiment of the invention is thus concerned with identifying groups of classification values corresponding to a set of data, where each data item in the set is characterised by a plurality of attributes, and each attribute has one of a plurality of attribute values associated therewith. The method comprises the steps of: (i) selecting an attribute; (ii) identifying, on the basis of the distribution of attribute values, two classification values that are least similar to one another and allocating a first identified classification value to a first group and a second identified classification value to a second group; (iii) allocating each unidentified classification value to one of the groups in dependence on correlation between the unidentified classification value and the first and second identified classification values;(iv) evaluating an association between the first and second groups and the selected attribute;(v) repeating steps (i) to (iv) for each of at least some of the plurality of attributes;(vi) comparing associations evaluated at step (iv) and selecting first and second groups corresponding to the weakest association; (vii) for each of the first and second groups repeating steps (i) to (vi) for the classification values therein, until the association evaluated at step (iv) falls below a predetermined threshold value. Essentially classification groups are repeatedly analysed with respect to a range of attributes so as to identify all possible groupings of classification values. For example, classification values Daily Mail, Daily Express, The Times, The Guardian, Vogue, New Scientist, Economist, Cosmopolitan, FHM, House and Garden are analysed with respect to a selection of attributes (e.g. sex, age, occupation etc.). Assuming that the analysis identifies the classification values as falling within two classification groups: [Daily Mail, Daily Express, Cosmopolitan, FHM] and [The Times, The Guardian, Vogue, New Scientist, Economist, House and Garden], each of these groups is then analysed with respect to the same, or a different, selection of attributes. This second round of analysis may identify further clusters of classification values - e.g. the analysis could show that the classification values in the latter group are clustered into two distinct groups: [House and Garden, Vogue] and [The Times, The Guardian, New Scientist, Economist]. After each round of analysis an association between the groups and attributes is measured and is compared with a threshold; this comparison identifies whether or not the groups are sufficiently different as to justify splitting up the classification values into groups.",G06F 17/30; G06K 9/62; G06K 9/68,"BRITISH TELECOMMUNICATIONS PUBLIC LIMITED COMPANY; HO, Colin, Kok, Meng; NAUCK, Detlef, Daniel","HO, Colin, Kok, Meng; NAUCK, Detlef, Daniel",02252733.7 18.04.2002 EP,

Proposed method without current application (in passive mode of operation) provides images which are obtained by standard thermal imagers. On the other hand, the application of the electrical current (in active mode of operation) increases the temperature contrast on the body surface depending on the electrical property of tissue.

A modified simulated annealing method (SA) is applied to the problem of robot placement in CAD systems, in the context of welding tasks. The objective function for optimization is cycle time, which can be obtained from available robotic CAD software. The research domains are simplified, and the SA method is applied to yield an optimal or near-optimal solution to each problem. To obtain the optimal placement of the robot, the research domain is first simplified by determining an acceptable base location domain, then obstacle shadows, which are subtracted from the previous domain to give the free acceptable base location domain. A modified SA method is applied to this domain, using task feasibility tests before simulating the cycle time, in order to save CPU time. The modified SA algorithm gives the global optimal placement, together with other local minima and an estimate of an efficient region where the robot may be positioned. <IMAGE>",B25J 13/00; B25J 9/16; B25J 9/18; B25J 19/00; G05B 19/19; G05B 19/4061; G05B 19/4097; G06F 17/50,DASSAULT SYSTEMES,BARRAL DAVID,41461899 08.10.1999 US,

The feature vectors and associated labelings are used to create a weight matrix. During iteration, the weight matrix, to be subsequently used for identification, is modified by determining which characters are incorrectly classified, or classified with too small a confidence, and replicating those characters during training to strengthen the correct classification. The correct classification is also strengthened by using negative feedback to inhibit incorrect classification by using negative values in the target vectors. The speed of the learning process is enhanced by maintaining intermediate matrices and step wise increasing the amount of each feature vector and the size of the sample set used during training.

At the server, audio/video streams are encoded into transport packets before being sent out. At the client, the dejittering process is achieved by a dejittering buffer using the embedded timestamps in the transport packets and a client decoding clock. The delay variations of data arriving are removed after the client buffering process. At the scheduled time, each data packet is shifted to a synchronizing buffer and then fed to the A/V decoder according to the speed of A/V stream. The clock synchronization between client and server is achieved by a synchronizing buffer whose half-size position is taken as the reference. By monitoring the movement of the buffer fill position over a given period, the drift rate of clock unsynchronization between client and server can be derived and, therefore, the client's clock can be adjusted to synchronize with the server's clock based on the derived drift. <IMAGE>",H04L 29/08; H04L 7/00; H04L 7/04; H04L 12/70; H04L 12/801; H04L 12/885; H04L 12/911; H04N 7/24; H04N 21/43; H04N 21/44; H04N 21/6437,VICTOR COMPANY OF JAPAN,XU JINGHONG,1998003578 07.09.1998 SG,

A subscriber captures the image of an encoded datagram associated with a product or service using a mobile phone or PDA or fixed line device and transmits this to a remote data processing centre. The captured datagram may comprise a variety of geometric shapes and language characters and even some custom graphics which may be processed in relation to a subscriber's profile stored in the device. The profile is used to provide different levels of quality of service and authentication for access to services in accordance with the subscriber's access rights. The destination IP address or mobile number used to access the service is encoded within the datagram itself so the subscriber need only 'point and click' and the software application can both identify, decode and direct a newly compiled data message to a known destination. In this way a variety of datagrams may be created, each comprising their own unique destination mobile number or IP address where each may be associated with very unique data services or system control services. Communication with a specific data processing centre may be via fixed line ADSL or via 3G services or GPRS or WIMAX or Wireless USB or be converted into an SMS text message. The remote server processes the captured data and either provides information back to the sender of the information or to their email address or initiates a process. Applications include data services, process control such as car park barriers, secure software purchasing such as ordering games from magazines where the software is forwarded to a known email address. Other applications include timetable updates for travel guides, or on advertisements, or in technical journals, or on food constituent labels, so that the data can be compared with current source data and dynamically updated as required to thereby replace or enhance the published information.

Video signals (1) are transmitted in a digital format, more than one signal being multiplexed onto a data stream on a single channel. The video signals (1) may be compressed for efficiency. A receiver (7), in conjunction with a signal selector (8), selects a particular NTSC channel for playback, then selects a particular video signal from the data stream, and decompresses the video signal for playback. Seamless switching between video signals on different channels is provided. In an alternative embodiment, the various signals which comprise the interactive program are switched at the head end (300) rather than at the receiver (7). The multiple choice control unit (9) selects a desired signal by relating the multiple choice selections of the user through a relay box (17) back to a remotely located switching station. The switching station routes the correct video signal down the appropriate cable channel for the particular user. <IMAGE>",G06F 17/30; H04H 20/10; H04H 20/28; H04H 20/30; H04H 20/38; H04H 20/81; H04H 20/95; H04H 60/33; H04N 5/44; H04N 5/445; H04N 7/08; H04N 7/088; H04N 7/10; H04N 7/16; H04N 7/173; H04N 7/24; H04N 11/04; H04N 21/234; H04N 21/2365; H04N 21/426; H04N 21/434; H04N 21/438; H04N 21/44; H04N 21/45; H04N 21/454; H04N 21/643; H04N 21/81,ACTV INC,HARPER GREGORY W; FREEMAN MICHAEL J,96920299 17.05.1996 EP; 44360795 18.05.1995 US,
