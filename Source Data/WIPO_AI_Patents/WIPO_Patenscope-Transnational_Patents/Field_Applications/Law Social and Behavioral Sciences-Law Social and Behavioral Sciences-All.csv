The system learns dynamical models of facial and vocal action from observations of a face and the facial gestures made while speaking. Instead of depending on heuristic intermediate representations such as phonemes or visemes, the system trains hidden Markov models to obtain its own optimal representation of vocal and facial action. An entropy-minimizing training technique using an entropic prior ensures that these models contain sufficient dynamical information to synthesize realistic facial motion to accompany new vocal performances. In addition, they can make optimal use of context to handle ambiguity and relatively long-lasting facial co-articulation effects. The output of the system is a sequence of facial control parameters suitable for driving a variety of different kinds of animation ranging from warped photorealistic images to 3D cartoon characters. <IMAGE>",G10L 15/00; G06K 9/00; G06K 9/62; G06T 13/20; G06T 13/40; G10L 21/06,MITSUBISHI ELECTRIC CORP,BRAND MATTHEW E,16933998 09.10.1998 US,

Instead of determining an output directly, the neural network determines the polynomial coefficients as functions of the physical signals indicative of other engine operating parameters. The sensor is manufactured using relatively limited data collection to calibrate a simulation model. The output of the simulation model is used for model-based mapping to generate more comprehensive maps used for training the neural network. The trained neural network is embedded in a controller and acts as the virtual sensor to monitor engine parameters which are difficult to measure or for which conventional physical sensors do not currently exist. The virtual sensor may be used to sense parameters such as in-cylinder residual mass fraction, emission levels, in-cylinder pressure rise during combustion, and exhaust gas temperature. <IMAGE>",F02D 41/14; G05B 13/02; G05B 23/02,FORD GLOBAL TECH INC,CHENG JIE; LACROSSE STEPHANIE MARY; TASCILLO ANYA LYNN; NEWMAN CHARLES EDWARD JR; DAVIS GEORGE CARVER,85282997 07.05.1997 US,

The efficiency of the calculations is ensured by the high training rate of the given neural network, as well as the parallelism of the calculation streams not only in the recognition of images, but in the neural network training. Furthermore, the described neural network model can easily be realized in the form of an analogue arrangement, which significantly improves the efficiency of its apparative realization. The said neural network training is based on a novel structure and a novel principle of functioning of the neural synapse forming the neural network structure and performing the function of transmission and transformation of a signal. The training takes place under counter-propagation of direct and backward signals, where the direct signal performs the recognition of the image, and the counter (reverse) signal ensures the neural network training. The difference in the direct and reverse signals at the output of the neuron is the basis for error compensation and, consequently, leads to the training of the neuron and the whole neural network. The information carrier (memory) in the given neural network is dendrites (neuron inputs), and also neuron synapses with dendrites of other neurons. The structure of the connections between the neurons is in principle unimportant. The contribution of dendrites is defined not only by weight coefficient, and by weight ranges. Training is carried out by modification of parameters of synapses and weight ranges of dendrites of a neuron. Thus, plasticity of a neural network is ensured not only by identical weights of dendrites, but through ranges of the weights of dendrites and adaptation of the functions of signal transformation (transfer functions) on synapses. Synapses ensure not simple signal transmission between neurons, but also transform these signals. Notably, transformation of signals on synapses has the complex non-linear functional nature depending on value of a signal coming at the synapse.",G06N 3/04; G06N 3/08,"PESCIANSCHI, Dmitri; FRENKEL, Christina; FRENKEL, Daniel; HAEMMERLING, Valentin","PESCIANSCHI, Dmitri",,

Workload factors can indicate the number of pending calls, the number of available operators, the average idle time, the connection delay, the completion rate, and the nuisance call rate, among other things. In the preferred embodiment, each call record also contains a dial action, which indicates whether a call was initiated or not. These call records are analyzed by a neural network (40) to determine a relationship between the input parameters and the dial action stored in each call record. This analysis is done as part of the training process for the neural network. After this relationship is determined, the computer system sends a current group of input parameters to the neural network, and, based on the analysis of the previous call records, the neural network determines whether a call should be initiated or not. The neural network bases its decision on the complex relationship it has learned from its training data -- perhaps several thousand call records spanning several days, months, or even years.

The pairs of clusters are burned and separated in a staging sequence until the final stage is reached. In the presently preferred embodiment, there are three pairs of engine clusters (10A-B,12A-B,14A-B) arranged in a hexagonal configuration about the central pod and each engine cluster contains seven identical engines. The engines are made from light-weight, low-cost materials, without gimbals or other moving parts. Steering of the vehicle is effected by differential control of the engine thrusts of selected engines (18), using duty-cycle modulation of a plurality of on/off propellant supply valves (50A-B-C) and, additionally, control of other on/off valves controlling the supply of an inert cryogenic fluid to secondary injection ports (38) on the engine. An onboard gas generator provides inert gas for fluid pressurization and preferably uses as its principal reactant the same material used as the cryogenic fluid. Navigation is effected with inexpensive onboard systems and the entire vehicle provides a dramatic reduction in cost in comparison with conventional launch vehicles. <IMAGE>",B64G 1/24; B64G 1/40; B64G 1/00; B64G 1/00; B64G 1/24; B64G 1/26; B64G 1/40; B64G 1/64; F02K 9/76; F02K 9/80; F42B 15/36,MICROCOSM INC,KEITH EDWARD L; BAUER THOMAS P,52980895 18.09.1995 US,

The knowledge base of the expert system consists of a hierarchy of terms and their definitions. To produce an expert response, an inference engine component of the expert system evaluates a term by evaluating all of the definitions for the terms which are in that term's hierarchy of definitions. In the document generation system, the terms include fragment terms which are defined as portions of the template document. Other terms of the knowledge base may appear within the portion. The document generation system includes a term definition component which, when the user defines a fragment term, provides the editor to the user so that the user can write the fragment represented by the fragment term. After the user has defined the fragment term, the term definition component adds the fragment term to the knowledge base and verifies that any other terms in the portion are defined in the knowledge base. If they are not, the user is asked for a definition. To produce a document, the inference engine evaluates a term which is defined in terms of one or more fragment terms. When the evaluation indicates that a fragment term is to be included in the document, the inference engine uses the editor to retrieve any other terms in the fragment, evaluates the other terms, and then uses the editor to copy the fragment term's text from the template document to the document being produced and to replace the other terms in the document being produced with their values.",G06F 17/24; G06N 5/04,"WANG LABORATORIES, INC.","GOLDSTEIN, Henry; SHANNON, David, F.; BOLLING, Richard, W.; RUSTICI, Eric","371,434 05.06.1989 US",EP-1990907960; CA-2057857

The training set is re-written as set of binary vectors, where each tag which occurs in the training set is an attribute. The order of tags is important. The binary vectors are then submitted to an algorithm which will induce a decision tree which classifies the training set into positive and negative examples. Since each possible path through the tree corresponds to a rule, the tree yields a set of rules for distinguishing positive and negative sentences. The rules are expressed in terms of the attributes, i.e. the word class tags. These rules can be applied to the test set, in order to reclassify each member sentence as positive or negative. A comparison is then made with the original and authentic classification for the test set. Thus, the % error rate can be calculated.

Subjected to any data, the present embodiment automatically identifies the relevant variables and constructs the most effective combination of the said relevant variables to achieve one or more objectives. The objective could be for high explanatory power, or high predictive power, or response measure, or other objectives that the user defined within the fitness function. Since the present embodiment will automatically construct the variables composition when subjected to any data to satisfy the objective(s) defined in the fitness function, it is in effect, an adaptive multivariate model building methodology. In other words, the present embodiment's algorithm also solves the need for dynamic capability in multivariate models since its adaptive evolutionary nature will automatically detect and incorporate the most relevant variables. By employing genetic algorithm, the present embodiment can find global optima or near global optima of appropriate variables combination in an acceptable amount of time and resources that are much less than using full variables permutation methodology. The present embodiment, by utilizing genetic algorithm, solves the sequential F-test problem by conducting non- sequential and non-linear search. This is accomplished by allowing at least one or a plurality of genes mutation in random order, hence including or excluding at least one variable in random order. The algorithm solves partial F-test dilemma by the fact that the variable test procedure evaluates the whole genome (i.e. all candidate variables intact) maintaining fidelity of full variables membership test throughout its permutation. Furthermore, the stochastic nature of genetic algorithm neutralizes the prejudices of manual decisions in variables identification, unlike its human modeler counterpart. Variables membership by the algorithm is based on 'survival of the fittest', in which the best genomes (i.e. best combination of variables) will emerge after as the optimal solution among the best of breed. In short, genetic algorithm determines the optimal and a pool of close to optimal multivariate models. The algorithm operates by modifying the parameters of the multivariate models by which it is in fact changing the composition of appropriate variables in the models. Genome population is generated iteratively by the algorithm until the criteria(s) of the desired genome that represent the desired multivariate model has been found within allowable time and reasonable resources.",G06F 17/00,"SOETJAHJA, Hendra","SOETJAHJA, Hendra","60/894,214 10.03.2007 US",EP-2008731411

Investigations into antigen processing and display have immense implications in human health, disease and therapy. To extend understanding of the rules governing antigen processing and presentation, immunopurified peptides from B cells, each expressing a single HLA class I allele, were profiled using accurate mass, high-resolution liquid chromatography- mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). A resource dataset containing thousands of peptides bound to 28 distinct class I HLA-A, -B, and -C alleles was generated by implementing a novel allele-specific database search strategy. Applicants discovered new binding motifs, established the role of gene expression in peptide presentation and improved prediction of HLA-peptide binding by using these data to train machine-learning models.

Consequently, a lot of effort is dedicated to distinguishing between two or more similar classification objects, meaning that supervised learning procedures are slow and produce classifiers that are excessively large. Moreover, the classifiers are often difficult to understand, and take a long time to be generated. Embodiments of the invention are concerned with reducing the number of classification values that can be used to classify a data item. Relationships between classification values are identified on the basis of attribute values in a set of training data, and those classification values that are determined to be related to one another are subsumed into a single classification group. An embodiment of the invention is thus concerned with identifying groups of classification values corresponding to a set of data, where each data item in the set is characterised by a plurality of attributes, and each attribute has one of a plurality of attribute values associated therewith. The method comprises the steps of: (i) selecting an attribute; (ii) identifying, on the basis of the distribution of attribute values, two classification values that are least similar to one another and allocating a first identified classification value to a first group and a second identified classification value to a second group; (iii) allocating each unidentified classification value to one of the groups in dependence on correlation between the unidentified classification value and the first and second identified classification values;(iv) evaluating an association between the first and second groups and the selected attribute;(v) repeating steps (i) to (iv) for each of at least some of the plurality of attributes;(vi) comparing associations evaluated at step (iv) and selecting first and second groups corresponding to the weakest association; (vii) for each of the first and second groups repeating steps (i) to (vi) for the classification values therein, until the association evaluated at step (iv) falls below a predetermined threshold value. Essentially classification groups are repeatedly analysed with respect to a range of attributes so as to identify all possible groupings of classification values. For example, classification values Daily Mail, Daily Express, The Times, The Guardian, Vogue, New Scientist, Economist, Cosmopolitan, FHM, House and Garden are analysed with respect to a selection of attributes (e.g. sex, age, occupation etc.). Assuming that the analysis identifies the classification values as falling within two classification groups: [Daily Mail, Daily Express, Cosmopolitan, FHM] and [The Times, The Guardian, Vogue, New Scientist, Economist, House and Garden], each of these groups is then analysed with respect to the same, or a different, selection of attributes. This second round of analysis may identify further clusters of classification values - e.g. the analysis could show that the classification values in the latter group are clustered into two distinct groups: [House and Garden, Vogue] and [The Times, The Guardian, New Scientist, Economist]. After each round of analysis an association between the groups and attributes is measured and is compared with a threshold; this comparison identifies whether or not the groups are sufficiently different as to justify splitting up the classification values into groups.",G06F 17/30; G06K 9/62; G06K 9/68,"BRITISH TELECOMMUNICATIONS PUBLIC LIMITED COMPANY; HO, Colin, Kok, Meng; NAUCK, Detlef, Daniel","HO, Colin, Kok, Meng; NAUCK, Detlef, Daniel",02252733.7 18.04.2002 EP,

Accurate and non-biased prenatal prediction of postnatal disease evolution is currently lacking, but is essential for prenatal counseling and disease management. Here the inventors aimed to develop an objective and quantifiable risk prediction method based on amniotic fluid (AF) peptides. 178 fetuses with bilateral CAKUT were included in a prospective multicenter study. The AF peptide content was studied using capillary electrophoresis coupled to mass spectrometry. The endpoint was early-onset renal failure (CKD stage 3-5) or death due to end-stage renal disease at two years of age. Among the ~7000 peptide candidates, 98 were associated with early severe renal failure. The most frequently found peptides associated with severe disease were fragments from extracellular matrix proteins and thymosin-P4. Combination of those 98 peptides in a classifier lead to the prediction of postnatal renal outcome in a blinded validation set of 51 patients with a 88% (95%CI: 64-98) sensitivity, 97% (95%CI: 85-100) specificity and an AUC of 0.96 (95%CI: 0.87-1.00), outperforming predictions based on currently used clinical methods. The classifier also predicted normal postnatal renal function in 75% of terminated pregnancies where fetopathology showed kidneys compatible with normal life. Analysis of AF peptides thus allows a precise and quantifiable prediction of postnatal renal function in bilateral CAKUT with potential major impact on pre- and postnatal disease management.",G01N 33/68,INSERM (INSTITUT NATIONAL DE LA SANTÉ ET DE LA RECHERCHE MÉDICALE); UNIVERSITÉ PAUL SABATIER TOULOUSE III; CENTRE HOSPITALIER UNIVERSITAIRE DE TOULOUSE,"SCHANSTRA, Joost; KLEIN, Julie; BREUIL, Benjamin; DECRAMER, Stéphane; BUFFIN-MEYER, Bénédicte",18306197.7 14.09.2018 EP,

Taking them into account, a first analytical model is formed, to describe production as a function of time. Optimum fit is obtained, based on a finite number of production values from simulation. - Starting from the first analytical model, a second analytical model is obtained as a function of the technical parameters determined initially. In addition, selected economic parameters are taken into account. A criterion is evaluated, with due regard to production uncertainties related to uncertain technical parameters. Sensitivity analysis is effected. Starting from the second model, uncertainties concerning deposit profitability are determined as a function of technical and economic parameter uncertainties. A probability density is associated with each of the economic and technical parameters, then re-sampling is employed. The Monte Carlo- or Bootstrap method is used. Using the second model, technical and economic parameters are optimized. Further developments of the method are described in accordance with the foregoing principles. Neural network methodology is invoked. At least one uncertainty parameter associated with the deposit is of a discrete, continuous or stochastic nature.

A masking field is a multiple scale, self-similar, automatically gain-controlled cooperative-competitive feedback network F2. Network F2 receives input patterns from an adaptive filter F1 ← F2 that is activated by a prior processing level F1 and behaves like a content-addressable memory. It activates compressed recognition codes that are predictive with respect to the activation patterns flickering across, and competitively inhibits, or masks, codes which are unpredictive with respect to the F1 patterns. In particular, a masking field can simultaneously detect multiple groupings within its input patterns and assign activation weights to the codes for these groupings which are predictive with respect to the contextual information embedded within the patterns and the prior learning of the system. A masking field automatically rescales its sensitivity as the overall size of an input pattern changes, yet also remains sensitive to the microstructure within each input pattern. In this way, masking field more strongly activates a code for the whole F1 pattern than for its salient parts, yet amplifies the code for a pattern part when it becomes a pattern whole in a new input context. A masking field can also be primed by inputs from F1: it can activate codes which represent predictions of how the F1 pattern may envolve in the subsequent time interval. Network F2 also exhibits an adaptive sharpening property: repetition of a familiar F1 pattern can tune the adaptive filter to elicit a more focal spatial activation of its F2 recognition code than does an unfamiliar input pattern. The F2 recognition code also becomes less distributed when an input pattern contains more contextual information on which to base an unambiguous prediction of which F1 pattern is being processed. Thus a masking field suggests a solution of the credit assignment problem by embodying a real-time code for the predictive evidence contained within its input patterns. Such capabilities are useful in speech recognition, visual object recognition, and cognitive information processing. An absolutely stable design for a masking field is disclosed through an analysis of the computer simulations. This design suggests how associative mechanisms, cooperative-competitive interactions, and modulatory gating signals can be joined together to regulate the learning of compressed recognition codes.",G06K 9/66; G10L 15/16,THE TRUSTEES OF BOSTON UNIVERSITY,"GROSSBERG, Stephen; COHEN, Michael","802,479 27.11.1985 US; 934,412 24.11.1986 US",EP-1986907225

For example, the predetermined subpoints can be used to enable the plant to meet regulatory needs while controlling for other parameters such as cost, chemical fees, flow rates and power consumption. The system and method include a non-linear predictive model for turbidity. The system considers the influent water quality and analyzes treatment options available to predict the dose of various chemicals required to get desired treatment. It will then predict plant performance resulting from intended operator changes in real time. The system preferably includes general regression neural networks with modeling modifications to learn if the works including learning patterns to make predictions and cost for operations control of unit operations and/or the system. The system includes virtual sensors for parameters that cannot be detected on-line. The system and method determine sufficient data to monitor and control all water quality parameters in the water treatment plant.

EP13461353,99305271,02.07.1999,1065601,03.01.2001,EP,Training process,"Neural networks and other trainable processes are generally trained by attempting to find a set of weighting values, (one for each parameter in the training data) which best matches a set of training data. Various iterative processes are known for deriving such a ""best fit"". However, because of statistical fluctuations in this data and other reasons, the weighting function so derived from a mathematical ""best fit"" may have unrealistic consequences for the physical environment from which the data was obtained. In particular, spurious results may be obtained for data points remote from the training sample.  In many cases it is reasonable to expect that the function to be derived is monotonic (its gradient never changes sign). It follows from this that the sign of each weighting value for each parameter should be predetermined. However, simply rejecting any parts of the solution space in which the weighting value is of the wrong sign can disrupt the ""best fit"" iterative process.  The present invention ensures that each weighting value w is of the desired sign by defining w as a function of an unconstrained variable v: w = f(v), the function being chosen such that for all real values of v, w is positive (or negative if a negative-gradient function is required). The ""best fit"" process can then be performed on the unconstrained variable v. Suitable functions include w = v<2>, w = e<v>, w =  v , w = v +  v­, w = 1/(1 + e<-v>) and w = log e<v> + 1­.  The technique has wide application in many fields where the relationships are complex and imperfectly understood. In fields such as economics, historical data can be used to generate an empirical relationship, which can then be used to predict future or hypothetical results. Another, more technical, application is in the field of analysis of audio or other signal quality, where subjective data from a group of human subjects can be used to assess the quality of a sample to provide the training data.  <IMAGE>",G06F 15/80; G06N 3/04,BRITISH TELECOMM,RIX ANTONY WILLIAM,99305271 02.07.1999 EP,

The proposed methodology is based on the hypothesis of that when a plant is in imbalance; there are changes in its metabolism that render an alteration of the chemical composition of its organs. This chemical alteration leads to a change in the physical properties, such as the fluorescence of the leaves. Due to the complexity of the material of the leaves, the present method proposes that the signal be treated with statistical methods and that the classification is made through softwares based on machine learning. As an example of the application of the invention, the results are shown for the Greening disease in citrus. Currently, Greening is the most severe citrus disease since there is no treatment available for it and due to its high dissemination rate and the fact that it affects all varieties of orange trees, being the diagnosis performed through visual inspection, which renders high subjectivity, high error percentage and the disease is only diagnosed after the expression of the symptoms (~8 months). During the asymptomatic phase, the infected tree is a source of dissemination of the disease.

The content of the state is changed by a learning/repair module (3) based on interactions between the system and the environment, and so reflects knowledge gained by this component as a result of its experience. The autotelic component (1) monitors its own performance with reference to the level of a set of one or more challenge parameters whose levels quantify the complexity of different parameters relating to the autotelic component (1). The state associated with the mapping mechanism 2 is altered depending upon the component's performance as evaluated during the monitoring. A controller (5) controls the levels of the challenge parameters. <IMAGE>",G06N 3/08; G06F 15/18; G06N 3/00; G06N 3/08,SONY FRANCE SA,STEELS LUC,03291714 09.07.2003 EP,

In one embodiment of the present invention, a decompression structure having a processor is provided with a global bus over which a decoder coprocessor, an inverse discrete cosine transform coprocessor and a motion compensation coprocessor communicate. The decompression structure in accordance with the present invention communicates with a host computer over a host bus and with an external dynamic random access memory over a memory bus. The processor in the decompression structure of the present invention provides overall control to the decoder, IDCT and motion compensation coprocessors by reading and writing into a plurality of data and control registers, each register associated with one of the decoder, the IDCT and the motion compensation coprocessors. The 2-dimensional display space is mapped into the external DRAM addresses by embedding in the address space X and Y vectors of the display space. The mapping of the X and Y vectors allows a macroblock of pixels to be stored in one DRAM memory page, so that an access to a macroblock can be efficiently accomplished under a page mode access to the DRAM page. By providing control to one address bit, data of four pixels can be obtained at one time in one of 2 pixel X 2 pixel ""quad pixel"" configuration, or in a 4 pixel X 1 pixel horizontal ""scan"" configuration. A structure including four of the decompression structures and a method are provided for decoding high definition television (HDTV) signal. In this HDTV decompression structure, each decompression structure decodes a 480 X 1088-pixel picture area with access to up to two additional 240 X 1088-pixel picture area.

It monitors the magnetic switches which are installed in the construction (window glass and shutter) of the door/window, it checks the window glass for a possible break through motion sensors, it detects the presence of external magnetic fields that are strong enough to disable the magnetic switches and it protects against any malicious short wiring of the alarm zone. It receives power from the alarm's control center and it has a trivial consumption of about 2mA. It requires no modification to the existing wiring of the house. It runs a special software so that no alarm can be caused by the excitation motion sensors from inside the house but only when someone breaks the glass from the outside and pass through the opening. False alarms from excitations that can occur from the exterior of the house , such as for lightning, has also been obliterated. In addition, the device enables the system to distinguish whether the opening of the window glass/shutter has been made from inside or outside of the house and thus enabling the tenant to open a door or a window from inside without the alarm going off. From this point strong algorithms start covering various scenarios in order to give the tenant a maximum of flexibility. The ultimate goal is that the security system should not restrict tenant's everyday live and so it will remain armed 24 hours a day. In addition, it gives the opportunity to choose between a smart operation as described above and a conventional system, which prohibits any dealing in construction by handling the control center's keyboard (any center that supports dual terminal resistance).",G08B 13/08; G08B 13/22; G08B 25/01; G08B 29/18,CHLAPOUTAKIS GEORGIOS,CHLAPOUTAKIS GEORGIOS,20100100257  ; GR20100100257  ; 20100100257 03.05.2010 GR,
