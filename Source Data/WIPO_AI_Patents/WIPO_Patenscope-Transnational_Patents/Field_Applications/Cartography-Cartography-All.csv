Since kMER adapts not only the neuron weights but also the radii of the kernels centered at these weights, and since these radii are updated so that they model the local input density at convergence, these radii can be used directly, in variable kernel density estimation. The data density function at any neuron is assumed to be convex and a cluster of related data comprises one or more neurons. The data density function may have a single radius, e.g. a hypersphere. A processing engine and a method for developing a kernel-based topographic map which is then used in data model-based applications are also described. The receptive field of each kernel is disjunct from the others, i.e. overlapping. The engine may include a tool for self-organising and unsupervised learning, a monitoring tool for maximising the degree of topology achieved, for example, by using the overlapping kernels, and a tool for automatically adjusting the kernel widths to achieve equiprobabilism. Applications include variable kernel density estimation with the equiprobabilistic topographic maps, with density based cluster maps and with equiprobabilistic variable kernel-based regression.

It uses a representation-rich, DNN-based subsystem (Module A) with a fast-learning subsystem (Module B) to learn new features quickly without forgetting previously learned features. Compared to a conventional DNN, L-DNN uses much less data to build robust networks, dramatically shorter training time, and learning on-device instead of on servers. It can add new knowledge without re-training or storing data. As a result, an edge device with L-DNN can learn continuously after deployment, eliminating massive costs in data collection and annotation, memory and data storage, and compute power.

Conversely, training a neural network with triplets of similar objects instead of triplets of identical objects relaxes constraints on the size and content of the data set, making training easier. Moreover, the notion of ""similarity"" can be almost arbitrary, making it possible to train the neural network to associate objects that aren't visually similar. For instance, the neural network can be trained to associate a suit with a tie, which is not possible with training on identical objects. And because the neural network is trained to recognize similar items, it can also recognize unfamiliar items if they are similar enough to the training data.

The types of methods presented here are usually known as self-organizing maps and are similar but not identical to the well known Kohonen self-organizing maps. The basic idea is a combination of data clustering and smooth projection thereof into a lower dimensional space (usually a two-dimensional grid). The proposed system consists of two modified versions of the functional of the well-known Fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm, where the cluster centers or code vectors are distributed on a low dimensional regular grid, for which a penalization term is added with the object of assuring a smooth distribution of the values of the code vectors on said grid. In one of the two cases, the faithfulness to the data is achieved by minimizing the differences between the data and the code vectors, and in the other case, the new functional is based on the probability density estimation of the input data. <IMAGE>",G06T 1/40; G06F 17/18; G06K 9/62; G06T 17/20,CONSEJO SUPERIOR INVESTIGACION; KEY FOUNDATION FOR BRAIN MIND,PASCUAL-MARQUI ROBERTO D; PASCUAL-MONTANO ALBERTO D; KOCHI KIEKO; CARAZO GARCIA JOSE MARIA,0000466 12.12.2000 ES,

Then, this input data feeds a neural network which may operate on the same network management workstation. More particularly, the neural network is a Self-Organizing Feature Map (SOFM) or an Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART) Artificial Neural Network. The output of the neural network is a list of device networks grouped in VLANs in such a way that the network devices communicating or having recently communicated together are grouped in a same VLAN. The input data is periodically updated in the network devices, consequently, the network device classification can be also periodically refreshed, the classification reflecting the real network device activity and thus be used to optimize the bandwidth in the switched network. <IMAGE>",H04L 12/24; H04L 12/46; G06F 15/18; G06N 3/04; H04L 12/24; H04L 12/46; H04L 12/56,IBM,BARILLAUD FRANCK,98480101 29.12.1998 EP,

Subjected to any data, the present embodiment automatically identifies the relevant variables and constructs the most effective combination of the said relevant variables to achieve one or more objectives. The objective could be for high explanatory power, or high predictive power, or response measure, or other objectives that the user defined within the fitness function. Since the present embodiment will automatically construct the variables composition when subjected to any data to satisfy the objective(s) defined in the fitness function, it is in effect, an adaptive multivariate model building methodology. In other words, the present embodiment's algorithm also solves the need for dynamic capability in multivariate models since its adaptive evolutionary nature will automatically detect and incorporate the most relevant variables. By employing genetic algorithm, the present embodiment can find global optima or near global optima of appropriate variables combination in an acceptable amount of time and resources that are much less than using full variables permutation methodology. The present embodiment, by utilizing genetic algorithm, solves the sequential F-test problem by conducting non- sequential and non-linear search. This is accomplished by allowing at least one or a plurality of genes mutation in random order, hence including or excluding at least one variable in random order. The algorithm solves partial F-test dilemma by the fact that the variable test procedure evaluates the whole genome (i.e. all candidate variables intact) maintaining fidelity of full variables membership test throughout its permutation. Furthermore, the stochastic nature of genetic algorithm neutralizes the prejudices of manual decisions in variables identification, unlike its human modeler counterpart. Variables membership by the algorithm is based on 'survival of the fittest', in which the best genomes (i.e. best combination of variables) will emerge after as the optimal solution among the best of breed. In short, genetic algorithm determines the optimal and a pool of close to optimal multivariate models. The algorithm operates by modifying the parameters of the multivariate models by which it is in fact changing the composition of appropriate variables in the models. Genome population is generated iteratively by the algorithm until the criteria(s) of the desired genome that represent the desired multivariate model has been found within allowable time and reasonable resources.",G06F 17/00,"SOETJAHJA, Hendra","SOETJAHJA, Hendra","60/894,214 10.03.2007 US",EP-2008731411

The training set is re-written as set of binary vectors, where each tag which occurs in the training set is an attribute. The order of tags is important. The binary vectors are then submitted to an algorithm which will induce a decision tree which classifies the training set into positive and negative examples. Since each possible path through the tree corresponds to a rule, the tree yields a set of rules for distinguishing positive and negative sentences.

Accurate and non-biased prenatal prediction of postnatal disease evolution is currently lacking, but is essential for prenatal counseling and disease management. Here the inventors aimed to develop an objective and quantifiable risk prediction method based on amniotic fluid (AF) peptides. 178 fetuses with bilateral CAKUT were included in a prospective multicenter study. The AF peptide content was studied using capillary electrophoresis coupled to mass spectrometry. The endpoint was early-onset renal failure (CKD stage 3-5) or death due to end-stage renal disease at two years of age. Among the ~7000 peptide candidates, 98 were associated with early severe renal failure. The most frequently found peptides associated with severe disease were fragments from extracellular matrix proteins and thymosin-P4. Combination of those 98 peptides in a classifier lead to the prediction of postnatal renal outcome in a blinded validation set of 51 patients with a 88% (95%CI: 64-98) sensitivity, 97% (95%CI: 85-100) specificity and an AUC of 0.96 (95%CI: 0.87-1.00), outperforming predictions based on currently used clinical methods. The classifier also predicted normal postnatal renal function in 75% of terminated pregnancies where fetopathology showed kidneys compatible with normal life. Analysis of AF peptides thus allows a precise and quantifiable prediction of postnatal renal function in bilateral CAKUT with potential major impact on pre- and postnatal disease management.",G01N 33/68,INSERM (INSTITUT NATIONAL DE LA SANTÉ ET DE LA RECHERCHE MÉDICALE); UNIVERSITÉ PAUL SABATIER TOULOUSE III; CENTRE HOSPITALIER UNIVERSITAIRE DE TOULOUSE,"SCHANSTRA, Joost; KLEIN, Julie; BREUIL, Benjamin; DECRAMER, Stéphane; BUFFIN-MEYER, Bénédicte",18306197.7 14.09.2018 EP,

This is an important problem faced in many law-enforcement applications on almost a daily basis. In such situations, investigators often only have access to the periocular region of a suspect's face and, unfortunately, conventional commercial matchers are unable to process these images in such a way that the suspect can be identified. Herein, a practical method to hallucinate a full frontal face given only a periocular region of a face is presented. This approach reconstructs the entire frontal face based on an image of an individual's periocular region. By using an approach based on a modified sparsifying dictionary learning algorithm, faces can be effectively reconstructed more accurately than with conventional methods. Further, various methods presented herein are open set, and thus can reconstruct faces even if the algorithms are not specifically trained using those faces.",G06K 9/00,CARNEGIE MELLON UNIVERSITY,"JUEFEI-XU, Felix; PAL, Dipan, K.; SAVVIDES, Marios","61/998,043 17.06.2014 US",US-15307099

A masking field is a multiple scale, self-similar, automatically gain-controlled cooperative-competitive feedback network F2. Network F2 receives input patterns from an adaptive filter F1 ← F2 that is activated by a prior processing level F1 and behaves like a content-addressable memory. It activates compressed recognition codes that are predictive with respect to the activation patterns flickering across, and competitively inhibits, or masks, codes which are unpredictive with respect to the F1 patterns. In particular, a masking field can simultaneously detect multiple groupings within its input patterns and assign activation weights to the codes for these groupings which are predictive with respect to the contextual information embedded within the patterns and the prior learning of the system. A masking field automatically rescales its sensitivity as the overall size of an input pattern changes, yet also remains sensitive to the microstructure within each input pattern. In this way, masking field more strongly activates a code for the whole F1 pattern than for its salient parts, yet amplifies the code for a pattern part when it becomes a pattern whole in a new input context. A masking field can also be primed by inputs from F1: it can activate codes which represent predictions of how the F1 pattern may envolve in the subsequent time interval. Network F2 also exhibits an adaptive sharpening property: repetition of a familiar F1 pattern can tune the adaptive filter to elicit a more focal spatial activation of its F2 recognition code than does an unfamiliar input pattern. The F2 recognition code also becomes less distributed when an input pattern contains more contextual information on which to base an unambiguous prediction of which F1 pattern is being processed. Thus a masking field suggests a solution of the credit assignment problem by embodying a real-time code for the predictive evidence contained within its input patterns. Such capabilities are useful in speech recognition, visual object recognition, and cognitive information processing. An absolutely stable design for a masking field is disclosed through an analysis of the computer simulations. This design suggests how associative mechanisms, cooperative-competitive interactions, and modulatory gating signals can be joined together to regulate the learning of compressed recognition codes.",G06K 9/66; G10L 15/16,THE TRUSTEES OF BOSTON UNIVERSITY,"GROSSBERG, Stephen; COHEN, Michael","802,479 27.11.1985 US; 934,412 24.11.1986 US",EP-1986907225

To this effect, statistical descriptive parameters of the EEG/MEG are measured and a map of its cerebral distribution is calculated. The map is the reverse solution of EEG/MEG based on: a) the restriction of the solution to structures with high probability to generate an electric activity by using a Cerebral Atlas and c) the solution has a predetermined uncertainty. The probability that said map or a subassembly of said map belongs to a template group is determined. To achieve said determination, the spatial correlation of the map as well as the dependency of experimental covariables are modelled. The resulting probabilities are coded in a pseudo-color scale and they are superposed on a Cerebral Atlas for their interactive tridimensional display. The Cerebral Atlas which are used in the solution of the reverse problem and for their display may be individual neuroimages, probabilistic Atlas or plastic deformation of a probabilistic Atlas with respect to the morphology of an individual. Said methodology has been called quantitative electromagnetic encephalographic tomographic analysis (qEEG-T).",A61B 5/05; G06F 17/00; A61B 5/055; G06Q 50/00,CNIC CT NAC INVESTIGACIONES,VALDES SOSA PEDRO ANTONIO; BOSCH BAYARD JORGE FRANCISCO; AUBERT VAZQUEZ EDUARDO FRANCIS; VIRUES ALBA CALLE; MORALES AGUILERA FRANK; TRUJILLO BARRETO NELSON JESUS; FUENTES MONTERO MARIA ELENA; SOLER MCCOOK JORGE MIGUEL; RIERA DIAZ JORGE JAVIER,1997087 22.08.1997 CU; 9800006 24.08.1998 CU,

In the general perspective according to the present invention, treatment is suggested based on a diagnosis and a diagnosis is viewed upon as recognition of a pattern. For instance, a diagnosis is the result of recognition of a pattern of antibody substances in a sample taken from the tissue of a patient. Furthermore, the term diagnosis has been given a broad interpretation in the present content so as to include - and/or even be- determination of treatment. The philosophy behind such an approach is that the determination of a treatment is according to the present invention based on determination of a pattern.

Perception subsystem 154 is principally responsible for perceiving objects within the environment of the vehicle, and can utilize FMCW LIDAR data 392 and optionally data from other sensor(s) 391 (e.g., camera 140, RADAR component 134) to detect those objects, classify those objects, determine velocities for those objects, and track those objects. Object detection and classification module 154A can provide an indication of pose(s) and class(es) for object(s) 394 to a velocity module 154B of the perception subsystem 154. The perception subsystem 154 provides the instantaneous velocity for each of one or more of the objects 396, and the pose(s) and class(es) for the object(s) 394 to the planning subsystem 156. The trajectory and/or other data generated by the planning subsystem 156 is then passed on to control subsystem 158 to convert the desired trajectory into trajectory commands 398 suitable for controlling the various vehicle controls with localization data also provided to control subsystem 158 to enable the control subsystem 158 to issue appropriate commands to implement the desired trajectory as the location of the vehicle changes over the time frame.

In particular, embodiments of the invention are concerned with reducing the computational complexity associated with ranking solutions to such problems with respect to one another. <??>Embodiments involve an initial ordering process, wherein the performance of a solution, on all of its objectives, is evaluated, and compared between solutions. In a preferred embodiment, the performance of a solution is evaluated by calculating the distance (in all dimensions) of the evaluated solution, considered as a point in multi-objective space, from the origin of the multi-objective space. The solutions are then preferably arranged as a function of their calculated distance values. Known methods, such as ""Quicksort"", ""Bubble sort"", ""Shell sort"", ""Merge sort"" or ""Heap sort"" (described in ""Algorithms in C<++>"", third Edition, Sedgewick, 1998) can be used to order the solutions as a function of the calculated distance. The ordering of solutions is such that whichever solution is closest to the origin is placed first, and whichever solution is furthest from the origin is placed last, in, e.g., a list of the solutions. The computational time incurred by this ordering is approximately O (N<2>) <??>Subsequently, the list of ordered solutions is input to a ranking process (which utilizes a conventional ranking process such as that described in NSGA). Since the first solution in the list is, by definition, on the Pareto front, then in order to identify solutions in the first level, the solutions only have to be compared against that first solution in the list. Essentially, therefore, the first solution in the list is the benchmark for the Pareto front. Moreover, once those solutions that are not dominated by the first solution, and are thus also lie on the Pareto front, have been identified and removed from the list, the first solution of those remaining in the list will be, by definition, on the second level Pareto front. <??>Conventional Multiobjective genetic algorithm methods incur a computational time of O (mN<3>) (where m denotes objectives, N denotes population size). Since the invention has removed the need to compare all solutions with all other solutions, the computational time involved with comparing solutions with the first solution in the list is now reduced to O (mN<2>), which is a significant improvement compared to other known methods. <IMAGE>",G06N 3/12; G06F 17/50; G06F 17/50; H04L 12/56; G06N 3/12; H04L 12/56,BRITISH TELECOMM,,02254649 02.07.2002 EP,

Additionally, the model can adjust the prioritization of network traffic for different time periods (e.g., days of the week, times of the day, and holiday events, etc.). Additionally, by prioritization of devices, congestion that may occur when devices tend to synchronize overhead traffic is reduced, as the devices, based on the prioritization scheme, will end up reporting at different times.

When, the wind turbine power production facility experiences a shortfall in its power production output it may make a request to the other source of electric power, and request that an increase its power output on behalf of the wind turbine facility. The substitution of one power production facility for another is referred to herein as a virtual energy storage mechanism. Furthermore, another feature of the present invention is the use of a renewal power exchange mechanism that creates a market for trading renewable units of power, which have been converted into 'premier power' and/or 'guaranteed' by secondary sources of power source to provide a reliable source of power to the power grid as required by contract.",F03D 7/04; H02J 3/00,"ABB AB; LOF, Per-Anders; GERTMAR, Lars, Gustaf, Ingolf; ANDREN, Lars, Anders, Tommy","LOF, Per-Anders; GERTMAR, Lars, Gustaf, Ingolf; ANDREN, Lars, Anders, Tommy","09/749,999 29.12.2000 US; 09/838,178 20.04.2001 US; 09/839,220 23.04.2001 US",EP-2001272775; JP-null

One approach introduced by the present invention is to first make sure the sales server captures as much information about browsers as is possible with respect to their activity on the website/ecommerce server. Then the server enables the enterprise to use business rules to define the population of browsers that are eligible for chat invitations. Out of this population, the server, on behalf of individual agents, approaches browsers as randomly as possible. As agents are entering into engagements and recording their disposition codes, the server periodically determines if it can identify any patterns in behavior of those engagements that end up with a good disposition code. For example, the server may note that browsers who were invited to chat in the 8th minute of their session and those who had seen 2 product pages end up in good engagements four times more often than the average browser. Once a sufficient sample set of engagements is conducted to allow the server to develop a statistically valid profile/model of browsers who end up with good engagements, the server compares all new browsers against this model and provides a numeric number representing how close the new browser is to the model. This number, called a score, is then used by the system to sort the browsers in real time and used as the criteria as to who should be approached and in which order.",G06F 17/30,"PROFICIENT SYSTEMS, INC.; RIJSINGHANI, Vikas; FREISHTAT, Gregg","RIJSINGHANI, Vikas; FREISHTAT, Gregg","10/980,613 03.11.2004 US",

The captured datagram may comprise a variety of geometric shapes and language characters and even some custom graphics which may be processed in relation to a subscriber's profile stored in the device. The profile is used to provide different levels of quality of service and authentication for access to services in accordance with the subscriber's access rights. The destination IP address or mobile number used to access the service is encoded within the datagram itself so the subscriber need only 'point and click' and the software application can both identify, decode and direct a newly compiled data message to a known destination. In this way a variety of datagrams may be created, each comprising their own unique destination mobile number or IP address where each may be associated with very unique data services or system control services. Communication with a specific data processing centre may be via fixed line ADSL or via 3G services or GPRS or WIMAX or Wireless USB or be converted into an SMS text message.
