This model first screens genes to reduce noise, applies k-means correlation-based clustering, and then uses singular-value decompositions to extract the single dominant factor (principal component) from each cluster. This generates a statistically significant number of cluster-derived singular factors, that we refer to as metagenes, which characterize multiple patterns of expression of the genes across samples. The strategy aims to extract multiple such patterns while reducing dimension and smoothing out gene­specific noise through the aggregation within clusters. Formal predictive analysis then uses these metagenes in a Bayesian classification tree analysis. This generates multiple recursive partitions of the sample into subgroups ('leaves' of the tree), and associates Bayesian predictive probabilities of outcomes with each subgroup. Overall predictions for an individual sample are then generated by averaging predictions, with appropriate weights, across many such tree models.

In particular, this invention allows the breakdown of highly complex biological spectral signals into high dimensional feature space where local features of each sub-space are accurately correlated with both a specific metabolite concentration or a categorical condition. Such is achieved by a new self-learning method, that requires no human intervention. The developed artificial intelligence is able to establish its own knowledgebase when new data is fed by performing feature space transformations, searching directions of co-variance and optimizing local composition-spectral correlations. These methods allow the artificial intelligence to establish knowledge maps of both quantifications and classifications, that can be cashed for higher computational performance. In particular, direct search comprises of finding across the feature space data and dimensions that allow a direct linear correspondence between metabolic composition and spectral bands variance. Moreover, a similar approach is derived for defining the convex hull regions of different class of health conditions from body fluid spectra. Such results in the creation of knowledge maps for both quantification and classification. The present invention also allows to evaluate 'a priori' the predictability, accuracy and precision of new estimates. Furthermore, this invention provides a self-learning approach to de definition of the global feature space using big data, for its correct characterization under high variability, accurate detection of local anomalies, as well as, outliers that can contaminate the knowledge base. This invention is applicable to all regions of the electro-magnetic spectra used in spectroscopy analysis (x-ray, uv, vis, nir, ir, far-ir and microwaves), or with any other type of spectroscopy (absorvance, reflectance, fluorescence, phosphorescence, Raman scattering) where complex multi-scale interference and biological variability is present.

Subjected to any data, the present embodiment automatically identifies the relevant variables and constructs the most effective combination of the said relevant variables to achieve one or more objectives. The objective could be for high explanatory power, or high predictive power, or response measure, or other objectives that the user defined within the fitness function. Since the present embodiment will automatically construct the variables composition when subjected to any data to satisfy the objective(s) defined in the fitness function, it is in effect, an adaptive multivariate model building methodology. In other words, the present embodiment's algorithm also solves the need for dynamic capability in multivariate models since its adaptive evolutionary nature will automatically detect and incorporate the most relevant variables. By employing genetic algorithm, the present embodiment can find global optima or near global optima of appropriate variables combination in an acceptable amount of time and resources that are much less than using full variables permutation methodology. The present embodiment, by utilizing genetic algorithm, solves the sequential F-test problem by conducting non- sequential and non-linear search. This is accomplished by allowing at least one or a plurality of genes mutation in random order, hence including or excluding at least one variable in random order. The algorithm solves partial F-test dilemma by the fact that the variable test procedure evaluates the whole genome (i.e. all candidate variables intact) maintaining fidelity of full variables membership test throughout its permutation. Furthermore, the stochastic nature of genetic algorithm neutralizes the prejudices of manual decisions in variables identification, unlike its human modeler counterpart. Variables membership by the algorithm is based on 'survival of the fittest', in which the best genomes (i.e. best combination of variables) will emerge after as the optimal solution among the best of breed. In short, genetic algorithm determines the optimal and a pool of close to optimal multivariate models. The algorithm operates by modifying the parameters of the multivariate models by which it is in fact changing the composition of appropriate variables in the models. Genome population is generated iteratively by the algorithm until the criteria(s) of the desired genome that represent the desired multivariate model has been found within allowable time and reasonable resources.",G06F 17/00,"SOETJAHJA, Hendra","SOETJAHJA, Hendra","60/894,214 10.03.2007 US",EP-2008731411

As an example of the application of the invention, the results are shown for the Greening disease in citrus. Currently, Greening is the most severe citrus disease since there is no treatment available for it and due to its high dissemination rate and the fact that it affects all varieties of orange trees, being the diagnosis performed through visual inspection, which renders high subjectivity, high error percentage and the disease is only diagnosed after the expression of the symptoms (~8 months).

It monitors the magnetic switches which are installed in the construction (window glass and shutter) of the door/window, it checks the window glass for a possible break through motion sensors, it detects the presence of external magnetic fields that are strong enough to disable the magnetic switches and it protects against any malicious short wiring of the alarm zone. It receives power from the alarm's control center and it has a trivial consumption of about 2mA. It requires no modification to the existing wiring of the house. It runs a special software so that no alarm can be caused by the excitation motion sensors from inside the house but only when someone breaks the glass from the outside and pass through the opening. False alarms from excitations that can occur from the exterior of the house , such as for lightning, has also been obliterated. In addition, the device enables the system to distinguish whether the opening of the window glass/shutter has been made from inside or outside of the house and thus enabling the tenant to open a door or a window from inside without the alarm going off. From this point strong algorithms start covering various scenarios in order to give the tenant a maximum of flexibility. The ultimate goal is that the security system should not restrict tenant's everyday live and so it will remain armed 24 hours a day. In addition, it gives the opportunity to choose between a smart operation as described above and a conventional system, which prohibits any dealing in construction by handling the control center's keyboard (any center that supports dual terminal resistance).",G08B 13/08; G08B 13/22; G08B 25/01; G08B 29/18,CHLAPOUTAKIS GEORGIOS,CHLAPOUTAKIS GEORGIOS,20100100257  ; GR20100100257  ; 20100100257 03.05.2010 GR,

There it is optionally combined with a reference beam from the laser source, modified (25) to emulate coherence length effects, and incident upon a phase transmission holographic template (30) that may be segmented into regions for example. Each region of the holographic template contains Fourier transform images of occupant types. Behind the holographic template is a detector array (33) that is sensitive to the laser light. An interference pattern derived from the object is convoluted or cross-correlated with the template. When an match occurs, a bright spot appears on the detector array. The location of this spot within the region contains position information. The relative brightness and location of spots within each region provide information relative to their classification. Using fuzzy logic, neural networks, or an algebraic algorithm, this information is decoded, and a decision made as to the type and location of the object.
