This approximation technique may insert an additional layer between the two original layers connected by the weight matrix. The dynamic range of the low-rank decomposition may be reduced by applying the square root of singular values, combining them with both low-rank matrices, and utilizing a random rotation matrix to further compress the low-rank matrices. Reduction of dynamic range may make fixed point scoring more effective due to smaller quantization error, as well as make the neural network system more favorable for retraining after approximating a neural network weight matrix.

The operator adjusts control points to keep the actual value indicator 62 within the range 64. As the process being monitored moves toward an out-of-normal state, an alarm management system 18 reinforces the graphic advice with general and then more detailed alarm messages that are displayed in priority order in goal and process message slots 114-122. Recommendations, in the form of an action script, for particular actions, based on expert system action indications, are also presented as the system state becomes more unacceptable. The invention also displays an historical perspective of the process parameters being monitored and, through a prediction module 20, provides a prediction of the future state of the process and process parameters. The alarm management system 18 compares the prediction with fixed position threshold as well as the range to produce event prediction messages.

Specifically, a trained combination classifier and associated final threshold for setting false positive/negative operating points are combined with learned intermediate rejection thresholds to construct the combination classifier. Rejection thresholds are learned using a pruning process which ensures that objects detected by the original combination classifier are also detected by the combination classifier, thereby guaranteeing the same detection rate on the training set after pruning.

Machine learning is employed to predict and identify a target element the user will select in the virtual document. Thus, event triggering occurs before the user has physically performed the interaction. In response, a request that would normally be sent from the application when the user interacts with the target element(s), is prematurely cached in a system and processed to retrieve the results of the request so that when the target element is actually interacted with, the results are immediately transmitted to the user device for viewing. This saves time in the system by processing critical path operations before the user has interacted with the target element, and ultimately, produces an improved user experience with the application.",G06F 9/44; G06F 12/08; G06F 9/445; G06F 17/30,"MICROSOFT TECHNOLOGY LICENSING, LLC","BORZA, Paul Valentin; PARIKH, Vaibhav; DAN, Ovidiu; SRINIVASAMURTHY, Kumar","14/973,087 17.12.2015 US",

The active vocabulary represents all words and word fragments that the speech recognition system is able to recognize. Each word may be represented by a combination of acoustic models. As such, the active vocabulary represents the combinations of acoustic models that the speech recognition system may compare to a user's speech to identify acoustic models that best match the user's speech. The effective size of the active vocabulary may be increased by dividing words into constituent components or fragments (for example, prefixes, suffixes, separators, infixes, and roots) and including each component as a separate entry in the active vocabulary. Thus, for example, a list of words and their plural forms (for example, 'book, books, cook, cooks, hook, hooks, look and looks') may be represented in the active vocabulary using the words (for example, 'book, cook, hook, and look') and an entry representing the suffix that makes the words plural (for example, '+s', where the '+' preceding the 's' indicates that '+s+' is a suffix).

In one or more implementations, an FPGA virtualization manager of a host device receives a request from a virtual machine for an FPGA program to program FPGAs of the host. The FPGA program is configured to program the FPGAs to provide functionality of a hardware-implementation of a respective program (e.g., a machine-learning algorithm) or of a respective device (e.g., a graphics processing unit). Before allowing the FPGA program to program the FPGAs, however, the FPGA virtualization manager determines whether the FPGA program is trusted to do so. To do so, the FPGA virtualization manager verifies a digital signature associated with the FPGA program. When the signature is verified the FPGA program is determined to be trusted.

These processes are not based on, and do not use, a priori representations of their environment or of the networks themselves. The system includes a number of cybernetic devices which are adapted to function as both the infrastructure of the network and the means by which the network services are delivered to network users. These cybernetic devices communicate with other cybernetic devices in such a manner so that the network is in the form of a fractal, non-hierarchical mesh which is self-similar. The cybernetic devices may be particularly adapted to supervise or ""mind"" one or more other cybernetic devices functioning at a lower level of aggregation or complexity. The supervised cybernetic devices may be clustered or distributed in space and be associated with machines, systems or people.

The doctor customizes a training program for his patient based on the target heart rate, which he then uploads on the memory card or directly into the training device via internet. 2. The patient plugs the memory card into the training device (or connects to the Internet), puts on a heart rate controller and has only a few indications to follow on the LCD screen (e.g. begin cycling, speed up or down, session is finished). The training device sets automatically the load according to the training profile and the target heart rate and uploads back the sessions parameters on the memory card. 3. After a series of sessions the patient returns to the doctor that can now download the information (on the card or via the Internet).

According to this method, feature selection can be accomplished by decomposing a given complex problem into a set of locally linear problems through local learning, and estimating the relevance of features globally within a large margin framework. Local learning allows one to capture local structure of the data, while the global parameter estimation within a large margin framework allows one to a\oid possible overfitting. This method addresses many major issues of the prior art, including their problems with computational complexity, solution accuracy, algorithm implementation, exportability of selected features, and extension to multiclass settings. Using the method, a small number of genes useful for predicting the occurrence of distal metastases in breast cancer patients were identified: LOC58509, CEGPl, AL080059, ATP5E. and FRAME. Also using the method, prostate cancer prognostic signatures based on gene expression alone and gene expression in combination with post-operative nomogram were derived.

Queries are defined by selecting predefined criteria rather than entering them as search terms, the former being more compatible with lean-back applications such as searching of electronic program guides. According to the invention, user profiles are presented and manipulated to operate with queries in the same way as other criteria. For example, in one embodiment, the search criteria are shown as the beads on respective strings, the strings representing categories of criteria. One of the strings is a set of user profiles that can be added to a query in the same manner as the addition of criteria. Criteria are selected to form a query by moving corresponding beads to a query string. User preference profiles can be constructed in the same manner. Profiles are saved and represented as bead strings that can be used in further interactions in the same manner as criteria beads. Profiles can also be the result of automatic machine-analysis of user interaction. Thus, the historical usage pattern of a user is used by a machine learning device to predict user preferences.
